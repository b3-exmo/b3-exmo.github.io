# 👩‍🤝‍👩 Polygamy
## Required for exaltation!
> *It is the word of the Lord, and I wish to say to you, and all the world, that if you desire with all your hearts to obtain the blessings which Abraham obtained, ==you will be polygamists at least in your faith, or you will come short of enjoying the salvation and the glory which Abraham has obtained. This is as true as that God lives.==*
>
> *. . . The man that [resists polygamy] in his heart, and will continue to persist in pursuing that policy, will come short of dwelling in the presence of the Father and the Son, in celestial glory.*

> *==The only men who [[Becoming Gods|become Gods]], even the Sons of God, are those who enter into polygamy==. Others attain unto a glory and may even be permitted to come into the presence of the Father and the Son; but they cannot reign as kings in glory, because they had blessings offered unto them, and they refused to accept them.*

Three of the four quotes above are from Brigham Young. Yes, there are more than four discourses on the matter, these are ones I arbitrarily picked. What I want to emphasize is that many former Mormon folks will point to Joseph Smith and his polygamous affairs as awful, incriminating information that tarnishes his claims to authority.

I don't feel like focusing on Smith is as much of a slam-dunk as other folks seem to think it is. I find all of the apologetics for Smith's polygamy to be vapid and nonsensical (I'll address some later in this page), but that's not really the issue. There's a lot of [[#Conflicting accounts|conflicting information]] about Smith concerning extramarital affairs.

**However.**

We can clutch our respective pearls at this idea, but... wait until you read about the latter succession of prophets. Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, et al were very much into polygamy, and were not discreet about it being sexual.

This presents a problem. The Brighamite sect of Mormonism leaned pretty hard into polygamy, and I think a lot of that can be ascribed to the titular leader of that branch, Young himself. I'll have some more notes on the succession crisis written in the future, but as I understand it, part of that change in leadership included retrofitting some of Smith's documents to support Brigham's ideologies, including polygamy. Say what you will in Joseph's defense, but Brigham took it to the nth level, and his polygamous branch of Mormonism is what has survived the centuries to be known today at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Smith had some polygamous escapades, and has had plenty of slander thrown at him— some founded, some unfounded. Brigham Young and subsequent church leaders were much, much worse.

&nbsp;

## Building up population
In addition to the retorts I've encountered that Joseph never practiced polygamy, I've  encountered many insistent explanations that *even if he had* practiced polygamy, there was no [[Consummation|boinking]] involved. So don't worry about it.

Since I find this argument to be nonsense, I do have a separate page of notes on whether or not these relations were [[Consummation|consummated]], including some explanations for why it really just doesn't matter that much. Having established that, I will continue writing about it anyway.

&nbsp;

> *Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God’s purposes in instituting, through His prophets, the practice of plural marriage. ==The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant in order to “raise up seed unto [the Lord].”==*

&mdash; *[Plural Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?id=p2&lang=eng#p2)*

Not sure how much more clear we can be. 

I'll then present that as a challenge to folks who would insist polygamy never involved sex: how are adherents going to "increase the number of children born" or "raise up seen unto the Lord" without doin' the dirty deed?

&nbsp;

### Prolonging existing life
This would all be an entirely moot point if God had revealed information like how to sanitize and purify water, how to treat diseases like tuberculosis, or had people better prepared before crossing the plains to Utah. We wouldn't need to replenish lost life if God taught people how to survive more effectively.

I guess hot water is bad, though, because you might get tempted to roast and grind some coffee beans, and it might *fall into* the boiled water on accident, and risk your eternal salvation. Better just avoid boiling your water altogether.

&nbsp;

### Adam's time
If Polygamy was just about building up population, wouldn’t you think there would be record of Adam having [multiple “Eve’s”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith)? That’s when human population was lowest, and to carry out God’s purposes if giving us all physical bodies, expediting that process would require more than one woman. As described above, Brigham Young did teach this. To date, I haven't encountered anyone else make this claim&mdash; I would think that if it were plain and obvious, biblical scholars would agree that Adam was polygamous. That detail was omitted from Genesis, Pearl of Great Price, and from temple ceremonies. It would be a pretty convincing precedent to be [[Restoration|restored]].

It's enough to make me think that maybe an adulterous, extramarital affair being called a "[[Sealing|sealing]]" to divert scrutiny was just that&mdash; adultery and diversion.

&nbsp;

There are numerous other circumstances and conditions where "building up population" would be a valid rationalization for throwing out social norms. I could argue that the settling of Salt Lake is one such circumstance, being so isolated from the rest of humanity. Within Kirtland and Nauvoo... not so much. Plenty of souls had human bodies in 1830, but still, LDS church leaders needed to be blessed with multiple wives.

Polygamy being only about population can be traced to *[Jacob 2:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30)*:

> *For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.*

Don’t exclude verse 27, though:

> *Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;*

&nbsp;

### Time and eternity
One last tangent on this topic:

> *During the era in which plural marriage was practiced, Latter-day Saints distinguished between sealings for time and eternity and sealings for eternity only. ==Sealings for time and eternity included== commitments and relationships during this life, generally including the possibility of ==sexual relations==. Eternity-only sealings indicated relationships in the next life alone.* 
> 
> *==Evidence indicates that Joseph Smith participated in both types of sealings==. sealings. The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary. Some of the women who were sealed to Joseph Smith later testified that their marriages were for time and eternity, while others indicated that their relationships were for eternity alone.*

— *[Joseph Smith and Plural Marriage](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng)*, Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo, Gospel Topics Essay

I remain baffled by the differentiation between *time and eternity* and just regular ol' *eternity*. Why. Are the two mutually exclusive? Does eternity, the notion of endless time, exist without time? How in the hell does that conundrum then translate to "commitments and relationships during this life"? Does this life not qualify as part of infinite time? I guess not, because somehow Joseph Smith will use that as an explanation for why plural marriage definitely doesn't imply anything else that marriage implies.

[Footnote 25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng#note25) at the end of the above excerpt reads "it is possible he fathered two or three children with plural wives."

But... nah, Smith never did anything untoward. Please don't look at subsequent church prophets, though.

&nbsp;

## Census analysis
Marrying fourteen-year-olds is not normal today. Don’t tell me It was normal in Joseph Smith’s time, though. I’ll concede that yes, humans under 18 did get married, even at ages like 14.

**However...** 

Fourteen-year-olds did not get married to men in their mid-thirties, nor did they get married to religious clergy with such a power dynamic and imbalance. Teenagers got married to other teenagers, not to the lord’s mouthpiece at threat of death and destruction, and the [[Helen Kimball#Appendix One|promise of exaltation for complying]].

&nbsp;

> **“But there were fewer men than women! Women couldn’t own properties so widows needed to double up.”**

— The explanation I had been told all throughout seminary

US Census Bureau didn’t have granular detail in the 1800’s, but it’s got enough aggregate data for us to determine if something fits a pattern. The granularity did get better with subsequent decades, but it was a bit vague early on.

[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) has census records you can download and analyze for yourself.

&nbsp;

> The 1850 and the 1880 census has the age and marriage status of each person but doesn’t have the age at which they were married. They have two data points that you can try and guess the marriage age. The first is a field for “Married in the last year”. If that is checked, then the person’s age is most likely their age when they were married. The second is a field for “Age of eldest child”. Subtracting that from the parents age gives a really rough estimate of marriage age.
> 
> The 1900 census also has the age and marriage status but it also has a field for “Years of marriage”.  Subtracting that from the age should give the marriage age.
> 
> Based off that data, here’s the numbers that I got:
> 
> - **1850 census:**
>     - Total married women for the USA: 3,156,838.
>     - Total married women under 18: 39,907 (1.3%).
>     - Total married women who gave birth before 18: 269,997 (8.6%)
> - **1880 census**:
>     - Total married women for the USA: 8,433,603.
>     - Total married women under 18: 68,473 (0.8%).
>     - Total married women who gave birth before 18: 649,562 (7.7%)
> - **1900 census** (this is a 5% sampling of the actual census):
>     - Total married women for the USA: 671,976.
>     - Total married women under 18: 5,310 (0.8%).
>     - Total married women who were married before 18: 107, 283 (16%)

*From <[https://www.mormondialogue.org/topic/67255-teen-age-marriage-ages-of-the-late-1800s/](https://www.mormondialogue.org/topic/67255-teen-age-marriage-ages-of-the-late-1800s/)>*

&nbsp;

### My analysis

I did get the census data for 1830 to do some cursory number crunching (as one does). Given the time period, black and white men and women are four different categories. I’ve summed up white male and white female, in buckets of 15 - 19; 20 - 29; 30 - 39; 40 - 49; Here’s what I found:

|              | 15 - 19 | 20 - 29 | 30 - 39 | 40 - 49 | Total     |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| M            | 573,196 | 956,487 | 592,535 | 367,840 | 2,490,058 |
| F            | 596,254 | 918,411 | 555,531 | 356,046 | 2,426,242 |
| M to F Ratio | 0.96    | 1.04    | 1.07    | 1.03    | 1.03      |

There were more men than women in this subset of fertile age ranges, among white census respondents.

This directly contradicts the apologetic that I’ve heard that due to warfare and poor sanitation that there were more women than men, and they weren’t legally allowed to own a home, therefore polygamy was for charitable purposes. No. This is empirical evidence that the reverse is true.

This does not mean that in places like Kirtland or Palmyra that the populations matched this exact ratio, but it’s the best indicator I can really hope for. Across America, for women aged over 20, there were about 40,000 more men. The idea that women were vulnerable and houseless is not far-fetched, but Brigham Young taking fifty wives for charitable purposes only does not work. I will not believe it.

US Census Bureau started tracking in 1890, and shows the average age for women getting married was 22. Grown adult men marrying sixteen year olds was not normal in the United States. In the church, it was.

&nbsp;

### SPECULATION ALERT
This is me thinking out loud, I don’t have data to back this up.

US Population at the time had more men than women. If in 1838, you hear a missionary tell you that a man can have a religious sanction to be part of polygamy, who is going to jump up and down with excitement? I suppose that women weren’t really stoked about it. How many women were dragged into it by their husbands, due to their lack of rights? A majority of marriage-age women who converted to the early church were already married. Those who did not convert were either born into it, or thought polygamy was a stupid arrangement, so they did not convert.

In early church membership there were more men than women (see above). Polygamy was not about charity, giving them shelter and food. It was about sex.

&nbsp;

## Angel with a Sword vs Joseph Smith
> *When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends ==additional messengers to encourage His people to obey==. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that ==an angel appeared to him== three times between 1834 and 1842 and ==commanded him to proceed with plural marriage== when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the ==angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction== unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.*

— *[Gospel Topics Essay: Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng)*

I can think of no other time in church history that a religious leader was threatened with a violent death from God if he did not follow a commandment, let alone a commandment that was morally dubious at best, and goes against social & cultural norms. “I’ve *got* to do this illegal thing, or else an angel with a sword that only I saw will destroy me!”

Footnote to cite the above claim is as follows:

>See Brian C. Hales, “Encouraging Joseph Smith to Practice Plural Marriage: The Accounts of the Angel with a Drawn Sword,” Mormon Historical Studies 11, no. 2 (Fall 2010): 69–70.

I did end up [[#Corroborating claimants|finding the source]] for this. I'll share some notes below.

Other note in that essay:

> *Although the Lord commanded the adoption—and later the cessation—of plural marriage in the latter days, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment.*

Well golly gee if only we had a spokesperson for God who could obtain and interpret His will

&nbsp;

Excerpts from [Encouraging Joseph Smith to Practice Plural Marriage – The Accounts of the Angel with a Drawn Sword](http://ensignpeakfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Encouraging-Joseph-Smith-to-Practice-Plural-Marriage-The-Accounts-of-the-Angel-with-a-Drawn-Sword.pdf):

> *So in the face of multiple anxieties, what might have prompted Joseph Smith to move forward personally and once again marry polygamously and teach others to do likewise? Several writers left accounts from the Nauvoo period that Joseph told of an angel with a sword who threatened him if he did not proceed.*
>
> *Several accounts relate how Joseph appeared to have felt genuine fear at the time. Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner recalled that the sword-threat was not symbolic: ==“Joseph told me that he was afraid when the angel appeared to him and told him to take other wives. He hesitated, and the angel appeared to him the third time with a drawn sword in his hand and threatened his life if he did not fulfill the commandment.”== Erastus Snow claimed that Joseph had “to plead on his knees before the Angel for his Life.” On another occasion, Joseph reportedly affirmed: “God commanded me to obey it [plural marriage]. He said to me that unless I accept it and introduce it, and practice it, I, together with my people, should be damned and cut off from this time henceforth.*

Seems odd to me that the pivotal figure in restoring the church would be “damned and cut off” after having founded the church, if he didn’t do this one particular thing that his family and peers disapproved of.

&nbsp;

> *The time arrived; but Joseph, in virtuous desperation, concluded rather to flee the city than be the medium of communicating a matter so repugnant to his mind. He mounted his horse and galloped from the town, but was met by ==an angel with a drawn sword, and threatened with instant destruction== unless he immediately returned and fulfilled his mission.*

I can’t claim to understand motivation or reasoning behind this, but that seems pretty uncharacteristic of God to arrange that encounter. [God’s work cannot be frustrated](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1), *unless* the one individual called to restore the Gospel hesitates when being told to get bangin' your wife.

&nbsp;

> *The following accounts help to clarify the feelings of the Prophet Joseph Smith and other Church members when plural marriage was first introduced.*
> 
> *==Eliza R. Snow==, who was sealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, recorded the details of the Prophet Joseph teaching the ==principle of plural marriage== to her brother Lorenzo Snow. She noted the anguish and pain that the principle caused Joseph Smith and that he only moved forward in establishing the principle because of divine revelation:*
>
> > *“The Prophet Joseph unbosomed his heart [to Lorenzo Snow], and described the trying mental ordeal he experienced in overcoming the repugnance of his feelings, the natural result of the force of education and social custom, relative to the introduction of ==plural marriage==. He knew the voice of God—he knew the commandment of the Almighty to him was to go forward—to set the example, and ==establish Celestial plural marriage==. He knew that he had not only his own prejudices and prepossessions to combat and to overcome, but those of the whole Christian world stared him in the face; but God, who is above all, had given the commandment, and He must be obeyed. Yet the Prophet hesitated and deferred from time to time, until ==an angel of God stood by him with a drawn sword, and told him that, unless he moved forward and established plural marriage, his Priesthood would be taken from him and he should be destroyed!== This testimony he not only bore to my brother, but also to others—a testimony that cannot be gainsayed [contradicted]” (Biography and Family Record of Lorenzo Snow [1884], 69–70).*

As an added bonus, in that same lesson in the teacher manual:

> ***Avoid speculation.***
> 
> *Do not speculate about whether plural marriage is a requirement for the celestial kingdom. We have no knowledge that plural marriage will be a requirement for exaltation.*

&nbsp;

Idk man, I think there's enough information to say that we do have knowledge that plural marriage is required for exaltation— that is, unless we're going to just disregard [[#Required for exaltation!|Brigham Young's teachings]].

I also feel uneasy about the warning against speculation. That sounds like they really don't want us to [[Culture#Thought Stoppers|think about it]] too much... or much at all.

&nbsp;

## Conflicting accounts
There are numerous documents to suggest that Joseph Smith did not practice polygamy. There also exist many documents to suggest that he did. There exists documentary evidence that later church leaders retrofitted Joseph’s revelations like [[DC 132|D&C 132]] to endorse polygamous behavior post-mortem.

We can banter about that until we’re blue in the face, as there is a multiplicity of well-sourced information to support both sides of that argument. What is ==not== up for debate is the prurient, predatory behavior of subsequent church leaders like Brigham Young and John Taylor. This presents a real dilemma. That dilemma will be further explored in the note section on the Succession Crisis... once I gather enough information to write about it.

Let’s assume that accusations against JS are exaggerated or outright fabricated. We then have to contend with the 2nd and 3rd presidents of the church. Did God command *them* to do it? Did they use JS as justification? If there was explicit revelation from God to do that, do we have a record of it? General conference, Journal of Discourses, D&C entry, book of commandments, anything of the sort?

If no, then we have a problem.

If yes, *we still have a problem*.

We can justifiably go with the explanation that Joseph Smith was called of God to restore the one true church, irrespective of the slanderous accusations against Smith. Does that mean that Brigham Young tarnished that divine authoritative lineage?

If so, the church as it stands today has strayed from the prophet called directly by God. That would mean we should stop giving those fundamentalists the side-eye, and give them some credible evaluation.
