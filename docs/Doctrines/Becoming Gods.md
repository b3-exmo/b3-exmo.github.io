# Becoming Gods
## Do Latter-day Saints believe that they will “get their own planet”?
> _**No.**_ This idea is not taught in Latter-day Saint scripture, nor is it a doctrine of the Church. **This misunderstanding** stems from **speculative comments** unreflective of scriptural doctrine. Latter-day Saints believe that we are all sons and daughters of God and that all of us have the potential to grow during and after this life to become like our Heavenly Father (see Romans 8:16-17). The Church does not and has never purported to fully understand the specifics of Christ’s statement that “in my Father’s house are many mansions” (John 14:2).
