# 🪄 Becoming Gods

 >***Do Latter-day Saints believe that they will “get their own planet”?***
 >
> *==No==. This idea is not taught in Latter-day Saint scripture, nor is it a doctrine of the Church. ==This misunderstanding stems from speculative comments== unreflective of scriptural doctrine. Latter-day Saints believe that we are all sons and daughters of God and that all of us have the potential to grow during and after this life to become like our Heavenly Father (see Romans 8:16-17). The Church does not and has never purported to fully understand the specifics of Christ’s statement that “in my Father’s house are many mansions” (John 14:2).*

> *Likewise, while few Latter-day Saints would identify with caricatures of having their own planet, most would agree that ==the awe inspired by creation hints at our creative potential in the eternities==.*

> *After men have got their exaltations and their crowns— have ==become Gods==, even the sons of God are made Kings of kings and Lords of lords, they have the power then of propagating their species in spirit; and that is the first of their operations with regard to ==organizing a world==. Power is then given to them to organize the elements, and then commence the organization of tabernacles. How can they do it? Have they to go to that earth? Yes, an Adam will have to go there, and he cannot do without Eve; he must have Eve to commence the work of generation, and they will go into the garden, and continue to eat and drink of the fruits of the corporeal world, until this greater matter is diffused sufficiently through their celestial bodies to enable them, according to the established laws, to produce mortal tabernacles for their spiritual children.*

I guess it's a good look for PR to deny a doctrine that sure sounds absurd, but... it's not so good of a look when the church's teachings literally demonstrate exactly that.
