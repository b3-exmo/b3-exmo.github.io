# Exaltation & Afterlife

For such emphasis on how this life is preparatory for our afterlife, we sure have vague notions of what the afterlife will be— aside from staying with our family forever.
## Families
What about folks who don’t want to stay with their family forever? I’m not part of this demographic, but there are people who are subject to abusive relationships in their family. Someone who gets beaten and raped by their father probably won’t see that eternal family as a selling point. I was subject to emotional abuse in my family. I would be okay with not spending eternity with them.

If we’re all descendants of a common ancestor, Adam, then… where do we delineate family? If you’re Joseph Smith and your brother just passed away, that’s probably as far as the consideration got.

Do we draw a line somewhere between Homo Sapiens and other humankind precursors? Do Neanderthals and Homo Erectus count as family, if we can trace our lineage to them?

How many generations back would it go? Wouldn’t that mean that everyone you see in Celestial Kingdom is family, and therefore being with family is a moot point?
## For women

[[Polygamy]] is already kind of a raw deal for mortal women, but the following quotes pretty strongly suggest that God and Jesus both are polygamists. If we’re spirit sons and daughters of God, it’s kind of odd to think that Heavenly Mother doesn’t refer to one individual. Could be one of many. Each of us in this room are from the same heavenly father, and there is a non-zero chance we’re from different heavenly mothers, if the second Prophet of the church is to be believed.

If Polygamy is an eternal law, and we are to become like God, then… that means that exaltation for women is to be a spiritual breeder, who shall not be named or known, and her children cannot commune with her. Does that sound like heaven? Watching children suffer through arduous trials on earth, and being able to offer no comfort, knowing they’re forbidden from even talking to you, or even knowing about you? Does that sound like heaven?
## Prophetic teachings

Brigham Young is a prophet, yes or no?

When he teaches that Elohim and Jesus are both polygamists, should be believe the spokesperson of Elohim and Jesus?

> “Plural marriage is the patriarchal order of marriage lived by God and others who reign in the Celestial Kingdom.”

John J. Stewart, Mormon writer, Brigham Young and His Wives and The True Story of Plural Marriage, 1961, p. 41

&nbsp;

> “Yes, [polygamy is] one of the relics of Adam, of Enoch, of Noah, of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of Moses, David, Solomon, the Prophets, of Jesus, and his apostles.”

Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 11, p. 328

&nbsp;

> “The Scripture says that He, the Lord, came walking in the Temple, with His train; I do not know who they were, unless His wives and children; but at any rate they filled the Temple, and how many there were who could not get into the Temple I cannot say. This is the account given by Isaiah, whether he told the truth or not I leave every body to judge for himself.”

Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses, v. 13, p. 309

&nbsp;

> “Celestial marriage is for the fullness of the glory of god. It is the crowning glory. A man has no right to one wife unless he is worthy of two…. There is no provision made for those who have had the chance & [opportunity] and have disregarded that law. Men who disregard that law are in the same situation as if they broke any other law. they are transgressors.”

Apostle Francis M. Lyman, quoted in Van Wagoner, Mormon Polygamy, p. 97
