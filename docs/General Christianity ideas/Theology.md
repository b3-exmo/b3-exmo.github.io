# 😶‍🌫️ Theology
## LDS God
Quick note: For clarity's sake, I'm referring to God the Father as [Elohim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim). That ~~name~~ word appears in [Hebrew](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Elohim) transcripts, and even in the [LDS Topical Guide](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/god-the-father-elohim?lang=eng). Its [etymology](https://www.theopedia.com/elohim) suggest that *El* may be singular, the suffix *-im* is plural and masculine. I surmise this is why the Nicaean Counsel took more than five minutes to settle on trinitarianism- the Hebrew transcripts are **not** monotheistic, as mentions of Elohim literally does not refer to one being, but a plurality of deities.

LDS Theology, for some reason, has settled on the idea that the Hebrew word for "two or more male gods" means the name of one individual.
### Oversimplification
According to LDS doctrine:

- Elohim created all of our spirits, but 1/3 didn't pass quality control and couldn't progress to stage two of creation. Did He do a bad job of instilling morals into us?
- This life (stage two) is a test, so Elohim wiped our memories beforehand so we wouldn't remember the correct answers.
- Elohim then sent Lucifer and the 1/3 failed spirits down to Earth to confuse us and lead as many astray as possible.
- But Elohim really does want us to believe in him, so he withholds all demonstrable evidence and requires that we rely on logical fallacies and coincidences. This includes feelings that must be interpreted as telepathic communications from your divine creator living on an exalted planet tens of thousands of light years away, not known demonstrable chemical processes occurring in your brain (which brain He designed and created.)

#### God's Plan for Us
Have his only perfect son murdered so he could convince himself to forgive you for failing the test and then use the blood of the Jesus to save you from failing! As long as you ritualistically pretend to drink his blood and eat his flesh every week, pay the club dues, obey your leaders, and covenant to give everything you have including your own life to one specific church. 

If you don't like that plan, prison is waiting for you on the other side. But wait, there's more! While you're in prison, someone in a temple will be performing nonconsensual rituals for you so you can choose while a gun is pointed at your head to accept Elohim's plan and enter a lower tier peasant heaven for second class citizens! You'll still be looked down on for eternity, but hey, at least you're not in prison!

After everything is said and done, the success rate of Elohim's plan will be significantly below 1%. He's omniscient and omnipotent, and must know how to do a better job, but clearly doesn't want to.

If it's all true, then Elohim is either the most incompetent god or the most evil god in all of mythology. Either way, he's not worthy of my time or consideration.

Don’t forget that even after passing the test, not letting demons sway you into doing bad things like drinking hot bean water, paying club dues for life, etc., you also gotta learn the right handshakes to enter to go back to live with your dad. Hope you’ve been wearing right kind of underwear!

God *requires* justice, but can't bring himself to forgive outright. So, he needs a *blood offering* to be happy with us.

Think of that. The God of Christianity requires suffering for sins, and we're made to sin. We're imperfect enough that it's inevitable. God made us this way! He requires blood to be happy with his creations!

### Is God's love conditional?
Well, yes, but actually no.
#### Yes, it's conditional!
> *While divine love can be called perfect, infinite, enduring, and universal, it cannot correctly be characterized as unconditional. The word does not appear in the scriptures. On the other hand, many verses affirm that the higher levels of ==love the Father and the Son feel for each of us==—and certain divine blessings stemming from that love— ==are conditional==.*

— *[Divine Love](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2003/02/divine-love?lang=eng)* , Ensign February 2002, Elder ==Russel M Nelson==

🤔

I can't explain why, but when LDS leaders use alliteration like that, it just gives me Facebook Boomer minion-meme vibes.

To be clear, Nelson in the quoted section seems to be focusing on the conditionality of *love*. I'm not making the argument that all blessings, salvation, prosperity etc should all be unconditional. While [searching for material related to this topic](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?lang=eng&query=unconditional&page=1&facet=all), I encountered many passages describing God's blessings, or the effects of Christ's Atonement as being conditional. I don't see those notions as problematic as love being conditional.

&nbsp;

##### Is that a problem?
Yes, that's a problem.

>*Conditional love teaches children that they are only worthy and deserving of love if they behave in ways that please the parents, not just for being themselves. They learn that their true self is wrong, bad, and undeserving of love. This affects their self-worth, their self-esteem, and their ability to create and maintain social connections.*
>
> *. . .*
>
>*Parents who love their children unconditionally teach them that the world is safe. When parents reject their children through conditional love, it teaches them that the world is not safe and that they can expect rejection. These children then grow up believing that they will be abandoned and rejected.*
>
>*. . .*
>
> *Similarly, they may be desperate for relationships to “prove” to themselves that they are wanted and loved, at least by someone. Desperate for belonging, love, and connection, they may use romantic relationships as stand-ins for the foundational love and support they never received as a child. Both of these are normal reactions to their experiences.*

(I didn't know this before- that long acronym means *Licensed Clinical Social Worker* and *Board Approved Clinical Supervisor*. I suppose it's an honorific prefix like PhD?)

&nbsp;

> *Conditional love is that which is provided only when the child complies with the rules imposed by the parents; That is, it is an affection subject to good behavior. When the child ignores these rules, the parents withdraw their affection from him.*
> 
> *In fact, it is a fairly widespread psychological control tactic that leverages shame and guilt by withdrawing attention and affection to manipulate the behavior of children. Conditional love translates into: “I love you, but only if you are good and do what I say.”*
> 
> *Conditional love conveys to children the idea that they are only worthy and deserving of affection and attention when they behave as others want. It teaches them that something is wrong with their true self. Therefore, they learn that they cannot be themselves, which ends up affecting their self-esteem and their ability to create and maintain healthy social relationships.*
> 
> *. . .*
> 
> *That ==“I love you if…” ends up translating into “I love myself if…”==, so these people also end up valuing themselves for what they do and the achievements they achieve. They introject that conditional love from their parents and are not capable of loving themselves unconditionally.*

**"yeah but those are just worldly views, philosophies of men, etc- they're not led by divine influence!"** - some imagined [[Logical fallacies#Strawman Fallacy|strawman argument]]

True. To find those quotes, I literally just googled "_parents conditional love_", seeing how we're taught that God is our Heavenly *Father*.

But what other implications does this idea of conditional love carry?

>*A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; ==as I have loved you, that ye also love one another==.*

— *[John 13:34-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?lang=eng&id=34-35#p34)*

Is this saying that "you should *also* love conditionally"?

&nbsp;

> *==As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you==: continue ye in my love.*

> *This is my commandment, That ye ==love one another, as I have loved you==.*

> *Ye are my friends, ==if ye do whatsoever I command you==.*

— *[John 15:9-10, 12-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p9-p14#p9)*

Boy, reading this with the context of conditional love does change things... for me, at least.

Jesus is straight up saying that Elohim's love for Jehovah is conditional, so that condition is being passed on to His mortal disciples on Earth.

Nelson's [[#Yes, it's conditional!|talk]] does outline [more examples like this](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2003/02/divine-love?lang=eng&id=title8#title8)!

&nbsp;

##### Anyone else teach this?
I haven't looked outside of Mormonism for an answer to that, but I can observe that [[#Yes, it's conditional!|address from Elder Nelson]] is an easy target to wail on for teaching the idea that divine love is conditional. For what it's worth, Nelson isn't the only one to teach that.

>*There are many ways to describe and speak of divine love. One of the [[#Maybe it's actually unconditional*?|terms we hear often today]] is that God’s love is “unconditional.” While in one sense that is true, the descriptor unconditional appears nowhere in scripture. Rather, His love is described in scripture as “great and wonderful love,” “perfect love,” “redeeming love,” and “everlasting love.” These are better terms because the word unconditional can convey mistaken impressions about divine love, such as, God tolerates and excuses anything we do because His love is unconditional. . .*

>*Because God’s love is all-embracing, some speak of it as “unconditional,” and in their minds they may project that thought to mean that God’s blessings are “unconditional” and that salvation is “unconditional.” They are not.*

&nbsp;

Call me a grouch if you think I deserve it, but I feel more inclined toward Christofferson's presentation of this idea- it feels more approachable. It feels like a charitable, patient clarification, rather than "you thought you were loved, but _psych_, you've gotta earn it first! Here's an alliteration to make that idea stick in your mind 😏"

&nbsp;

#### Maybe it's actually *unconditional*?
>*... all men are literally the children of Almighty God, that each of us is the spirit child of a Heavenly Father who loves us and by whom we are esteemed as one, who is as concerned and interested in the least of men as He is in the most seemingly righteous of men, who establishes and preserves laws which when lived produce blessings, which when broken result in sad consequences; but a God who, though He will not protect men from the effects of their own bad choices, ==unceasingly, unremittingly, unreservedly, unconditionally loves the individual==.*

>*I testify that he assisted in the creation and management not only of this planet, but other worlds. His grasp is galactic, yet he noticed the widow casting in her mite. I am stunned at his perfect, ==unconditional love of all==. Indeed, "I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me."*

>*The greatest example of love available to all of us is, of course, found in the scripture from John: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.” ([John 3:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.16?lang=eng#p16).) By the greatest of all acts of love and by this supreme sacrifice, God set the pattern. ==He demonstrated to us that His love was unconditional== and sufficient to encircle every person.*

hol up, now, my boy Rusty seems to have changed his mind

>*Explain to your family that they can turn to Heavenly Father when they need help learning to love one another. If they will pray with all their heart, they will be filled with his love and their ability to love others will grow.*

>*==Remind your family that Jesus’ love is unconditional==. That means he loves us no matter what we do and say. Explain to your family that if they are to truly love one another as Jesus commanded them, they need to love each other in this same way.

>*I can teach my family the true meaning of the spirit of Christmas. Celebrating is not just about giving gifts or the food we have on our table but the true spirit of Christmas is ==the pure and unconditional love of Christ== for us, our family and everyone.*

>*[Christmas] is a special time of the year for me because it is when people celebrate and remember the symbol of ==Heavenly Father’s unconditional love for us== by bringing His Only Begotten Son here upon the earth to be our Savior and Redeemer.

One could argue these two aren't "prophetic", but I don't think there's any question about who is publishing and distributing this printout

In conclusion... Who knows? Could be either way.
