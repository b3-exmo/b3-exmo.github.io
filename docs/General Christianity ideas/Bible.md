## Article of Faith

> We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.

— _[8th Article of Faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)_

What translation issues are there? Do we have any authoritative answer to specific passages that are changed/removed/incorrectly translated? Did [[#JST]] address all of them, and the LDS Standard Works OT & NT are now “translated correctly”? I should think that with all the materials and study manuals that the church has provided, we'd have ample time to separate what's accurate from those "philosophies of men" that got snuck in.

Without clarification, it sounds like this gives the church permission to repudiate specific parts, as if “that’s one of the mistranslated parts” but what supports our existing doctrine is translated fine.

The passage specifying that [women aren't allowed to speak](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) in meetings? Nah, that's a mis-translation. That whole [Stick of Judah](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/37?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) thing, though, they nailed that one. Inspired writing, it is!

## King James Version
Honest question- on what grounds is KJV the “most accurate” translation? Have we (in the LDS faith) examined the other translations? If so, when was that examination? What were the conclusions? How are we quantifying accuracy? KJV is certainly what Joseph Smith grew up with. Is that all the grounds we need?

> Today, English-speaking Church members use the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Version of the Bible. ==Based on the doctrinal clarity of latter-day revelation== given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, ==the Church has held to the King James Version as being doctrinally more accurate== than recent versions.

To date, I haven't found [record](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/search?query=king+james) of that. The claim in the above quote doesn't have a citation to back it up.

> It is not by chance or coincidence that we have the Bible today. Righteous individuals were prompted by the Spirit to record both the sacred things they saw and the inspired words they heard and spoke. Other devoted people were prompted to protect and preserve these records. Men like John Wycliffe, the courageous William Tyndale, and Johannes Gutenberg were prompted against much opposition to translate the Bible into language people could understand and to publish it in books people could read. I believe even the scholars of King James had spiritual promptings in their translation work.

The existence of such errors becomes apparent when one considers the numerous and often conflicting translations of the Bible in existence today. Careful students of the Bible are often puzzled by apparent contradictions and omissions.

> The [King James Version](https://www.cambridge.org/us/bibles/bible-versions/king-james-version) is the world’s ==most widely known Bible translation==, using early seventeenth-century English. Its powerful, majestic style has made it a literary classic, with many of its phrases and expressions embedded in our language. ==Earlier generations were ‘brought up’ with this translation== and learnt many of its verses by heart.

#### Could we get a re-translation?

> Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man ==that can translate the records==; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and ==it is a gift from God==. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.

> Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and ==the gift of translation==;

&nbsp;

> Behold, there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, ==a translator==, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ[.]

Bonus link: I stumbled on the JS Papers Project, original manuscript of that passage. Doesn't really lend more credence, but [here it is](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-6-april-1830-dc-21/1).

&nbsp;

I think its safe to assume that, if Joseph Smith was a prophet, that he is also a "translator." It'd be a pretty bad look if he were to be shown to mistranslate something, but we'll get to that later.
If JS was a prophet, seer, revelator, and translator, and that same priesthood authority got passed down to Young, Taylor, Woodruff, and so on down to Monson & Nelson, I should think that they could also act as a translator.
So... If, according to the article of faith, the bible can be used only "as far as it is translated correctly", I am left to wonder if Joseph Smith's own translation of the bible addressed those issues?

If so, why would the modern LDS faith not use the JST exclusively?
If not, why do we cite that article of faith? Moreover, could we ask Nelson, or any other modern LDS church leader to clarify or rectify translation issues?

## Joseph Smith Translation
The audacity?

> Because the Lord revealed to Joseph certain truths that the original authors had once recorded, the Joseph Smith Translation is unlike any other Bible translation in the world. In this sense, the word translation is used in a broader and different way than usual, for ==Joseph’s translation was more revelation than literal translation from one language into another==.

— _[Introduction page to the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/introduction?lang=eng)_

Oh. It’s not… It’s not even a translation? It’s a revelation accompaniment? Why are we calling it translation? It says right there it isn’t translation.

&nbsp;

## Plain and Precious things
> And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the ==plain and precious things which have been taken away== from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.

— _[1 Ne 13:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=40#p40)_

&nbsp;

This BoM passage is cited as evidence that the Bible is incomplete, and BoM fills in the gaps.

Legitimate question: what gaps?

If the intent of the BoM is to prove Smith's legitimacy, and his legitimacy proves modern church leadership, then no, the BoM is not filling in gaps- modern prophets are.

> “Surely ==the most plain and precious of all truths lost from the Bible==, particularly the Old Testament, are the clear and unequivocal declarations of the mission of Jesus Christ, his foreordained role as Messiah and Savior of the world, and the covenantal elements of his gospel, which have been taught from Adam down through each succeeding dispensation. ==Thus the Book of Mormon’s highest purpose== is to restore to the universal family of God that crucial knowledge of Christ’s role in the salvation of every man, woman, and child who now lives, has ever lived, or will yet live upon the earth.”

— _[Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2006/10/plain-and-precious-truths-restored)_, Jeffrey R Holland, Ensign 1997, 6–7.

Find me a fanatical Christian who didn’t already know that from reading the Bible alone.
