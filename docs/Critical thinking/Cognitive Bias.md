# 🧠 Cognitive Bias
How do we discern between faith and cognitive bias?

## Overview of Biases
Biases are not inherently bad. There is simply too much information in the world for us to ingest and process, in order for us to come to a reliable conclusion. We have no choice but to filter it, or else we’d never come to a conclusion on anything. Cognitive biases are ways out brain tries to determine what’s most likely to be useful. Our brains aren’t always good at this, so philosophically-minded folks have categorized some of these filtering methods as cognitive biases.

We don’t have all information on everything. We must extrapolate and fill in gaps. We are prone to doing this improperly. This notion isn’t really anti-religious, by my understanding. More of philosophical, neither for nor against religion. Recognizing them is used for logical discourse on any topic.

We are humans with emotions. This is not something to be ashamed of. I don’t care how smart one thinks they are, every human is prone to this. I certainly am. Try as we may, being consistently and constantly open-minded is not feasible. You, reader, should be aware of these biases. Then, compare how they fit with your existing beliefs.

### Oversimplification
A quick example of where this is going:

- Something good happens to the prospective or current Mormon? A blessing from God. The person is on the right track!
- Something bad happened to the prospective Mormon? Satan is trying to derail the baptism. The person is on the right track!
- Something bad happens to a current Mormon? Life is a test. This is a reminder to repent and obey! The person is on the right track!
- Something good happens to a former Mormon? It’s not REAL happiness. They have forfeited real blessings from God.
- Something bad happens to a former Mormon? Of course! The wicked will not prosper! They have forfeited real blessings from God.

## Confirmation bias

> The confirmation bias is the tendency to listen more often to information that confirms our existing beliefs. Through this bias, people tend to favor information that reinforces the things they already think or believe.
>
> Examples include:
>
> - Only paying attention to information that confirms your beliefs about issues such as gun control and global warming
> - Only following people on social media who share your viewpoints
> - Choosing news sources that present stories that support your views
> - Refusing to listen to the opposing side
> - Not considering all of the facts in a logical and rational manner
>
> There are a few reasons why this happens. One is that only seeking to confirm existing opinions helps limit mental resources we need to use to make decisions. It also helps protect self-esteem by making people feel that their beliefs are accurate.
>
> People on two sides of an issue can listen to the same story and walk away with different interpretations that they feel validates their existing point of view. This is often indicative that the confirmation bias is working to "bias" their opinions.
>
> The problem with this is that it can lead to poor choices, an inability to listen to opposing views, or even contribute to othering people who hold different opinions.

From the perspective of Mormonism, faith and confirmation bias seem very difficult to distinguish.

When questioning members are advised to "take your questions to the Lord and to other faithful sources," what kind of answer can they expect? They're only asking people who believe.

- As long as God continues to help me find my car keys, I won't think about all the suffering in Palestine and Ukraine. All is well in Zion. Zion prospers.
- Keep paying tithing because God has promised ‘blessings such that there shall not be room enough to receive them’, even though month after month we continue in financial struggles.
### Moroni's Promise
>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
>
>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.

— _[Moroni 10:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p3-p5#p3)_

Let's examine some of this.

>... and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ ...

Set yourself up for success. Have a sincere desire, have "real intent", believing you will receive an answer.

>... he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

You will receive a confirmation in a nonspecific way. Is it a warm fuzzy feeling? There's your answer. That verifies what you expected to find an answer to. It's true now!

What else do we do to set ourselves up for confirmation bias?

- Desire to believe ([Alma 32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p27##p27))
- Seek belief in prayer (If praying doesn't give you ‘yes its true’ answer, pray again)
- Study from approved sources (Just listen to things you already think are true)
- Bear testimony (repeatedly say it's true, put your reputation into it)

“I heard myself say that it was true when I bore my testimony so it must be true.”

> Another way to seek a testimony seems astonishing when compared with the methods of obtaining other knowledge. We gain or strengthen a testimony by bearing it.
