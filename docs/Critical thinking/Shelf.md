# Shelf

> Because of her family’s hospitality toward searching and studying, Sister Kimball says, “I’ve always had an inquiring mind. I’m not satisfied just to accept things. I like to follow through and study things out. I learned early to put aside those gospel questions that I couldn’t answer. I had a shelf of things I didn’t understand, but as I’ve grown older and studied and prayed and thought about each problem, one by one I’ve been able to better understand them.”

_From <_[_https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1975/10/camilla-kimball-lady-of-constant-learning?lang=eng_](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1975/10/camilla-kimball-lady-of-constant-learning?lang=eng)_>_

The term describes a concept or notion that you find dissatisfying, but have the optimism that an answer may appear at some point. Rather than dismiss the entire dispute, “shelf” it and come back later.

In former-Mormon circles, one’s faith breaking comes from putting too much weight on the shelf. Too many unanswered or unsatisfied questions leads one’s shelf to break.
