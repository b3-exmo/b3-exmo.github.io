## Hypocrisy

In the temple endowment ceremony, we are forbidden from selling signs & tokens for money.

In order for you to receive them, you must… pay money to the church. Am I reading too far into this? Are they selling signs & tokens for money with extra steps to obfuscate the transaction?

Moreover, **how do we delineate “philosophies of men mingled with scripture?”** Isn’t that what General Conference is?

### Priestcraft

Repackaging the gospel and selling for profit books under their own names on top of a handsome benefits package

LDS church owns Deseret Book. How many books are published by Eyring, or any other apostle?

Church leaders have a captive audience, who reveres their words. So… how many book deals does Dallin H Oaks have? Pick an apostle. How many books can you buy with money written by a church leader? Doesn’t this sound like an abuse of position? Doesn’t it feel dishonest?

I’m not aware of any rule this is breaking, but they are able to turn a profit (har har) off of their status as religious leaders.

### Secret combinations

How else would you describe a group of old men with insane amounts of hidden wealth where financials are secret and they use their power and money to try to influence Government policy behind the scenes and societal views through well funded marketing campaigns?

## Worthiness

We can point to some examples of Joseph Smith engaging in dubious behavior.

We can write it off as him being a product of his time, or an imperfect servant, or simply a mortal; God chose a flawed mortal to bring in the restoration, etc.

Why is worthiness for **anything** a relevant factor for us, then?

If a functioning prophet can do this important work of salvation despite his flaws (including but not limited to sexual predation and literal fraud), and God chose to work through him anyway, why, then, do we need to be counted as “worthy” to do anything? Enter the temple, be baptized, take sacrament, serve in a calling, etc

If I so much as drink coffee (something JS did on the regular) then I am denied salvation.

If I don’t pay tithing into an organization that hides its financial records and dealings, I don’t get to go to the temple.

If JS creates a fake bank, forges documents, engages in extramarital affairs, gouges Parley Pratt out of a home, he’s still revered as being a prophet and we don’t question his priesthood authority.

But, God have mercy on that 15-year-old if he jacked off once and then prepared sacrament. Can’t tell you how many times that was the topic of 3rd hour lessons on Sunday.

Same goes for Brigham Young. If we can point to his imperfections and outright egregious behavior, and still call him a prophet, why do we need to follow any rules? Is BY going to be in the celestial kingdom despite his imperfections?

## Thought Stoppers

The American Psychological Association says in an article:

“Members are taught to stop doubts from entering their consciousness about the cult, often with a key phrase they repeat.” “Repeating a key phrase” is also known as chanting a mantra repeating mantras is a form of psychological ritual that reinforces belief. In the case of cults, it is also an important aid in brainwashing”
