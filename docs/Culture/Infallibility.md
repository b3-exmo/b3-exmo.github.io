# Infallibility
## “[Be ye therefore perfect.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5?lang=eng&id=p48#p48)”

“Nah, we don’t ever claim to be perfect! The Gospel is perfect, our church structure / leadership / members / teachings are not perfect.”

Ok.

## Imperfect individuals

Can you tell me about something that, for example, Russel Nelson has done that you find problematic or disagreeable?

Or, more generously, can you list anything he’s said or done that indicates imperfection?

I’m not trying to catch you, hypothetical conversation partner, in your words- I’m observing that the inability to scrutinize any behavior doesn’t sit well with the idea that leaders are infallible.

If your answer is ‘no’, that’s an acceptable answer, as long as you don’t perpetuate the idea that the leaders are imperfect. I think one should be able to point to examples of imperfection, if we use the

Is the church led by God, or not?  
Are the church leaders (Q15) inspired of God? To what extent should we equate their behavior with divinity?  

### Thought exercise

I’m about to make up a dumb, hyperbolic example for illustration purposes:

If Elder Rasband, being an imperfect mortal, wants a whopper from Burger King, is his spoken order for fast food to be counted as divine or scriptural? No, that’s nonsense.

Another arbitrary, made-up example: If Elder Uchtdorf has a granddaughter about to get married, and he shares some life advice and wisdom from life experience, should that be counted as divine or scriptural? Not necessarily, even though those words may be valid, having been borne of life experience. Grandparents, seniors, etc have life experience, and can share wisdom from it.

Contrast that to someone like Dallin H Oaks defending Mark Hoffman’s documents, before they are found to be forgeries. He’s an apostle, directly confronting a theological matter. Was he inspired of God to do that?

Observing that the context of a church leaders' words is important and impactful, but please don't think that only works in defending them. If they proclaim something while acting under their calling, I'm going to use that to compare against their claim to divine influence.

## Organization

If we were to take a step away from individuals and leaders, and examine the organization as a whole…

Is there anything that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ™️ has done that you find disagreeable? Imperfect? Something you take issue with?

If your answer is ‘no’, again, that’s an acceptable answer, so long as you don’t perpetuate the idea that “we don’t claim the church to be perfect.”
