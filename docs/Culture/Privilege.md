# üëë Privilege
Amid writing, I've encountered things that a high-control religion like the LDS church wants its adherents to do. At face value, some of these things don't make sense, such as [[Tithing|paying 10% of your money]] with absolutely no accountability, or only wearing our [[Garments|special branded underpants]]. So how does an institution incentivize obedience to these commandments? We can use the ol' reliable "God said so," but in case that doesn't work, let's make the imperative hit closer to home&mdash;we'll tell you that *it's a privilege* to do what we tell you to do.

So I'd like to examine those claims. First, establish what the word means, and then find examples of it being used in LDS teachings. Yes, I am aware of the trope of Sacrament Meeting talks where the opening thesis statement is quoting Merriam-Webster, as if [George Merriam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Merriam) buying [Noah Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster)'s estate was by divine directive.

I don't intend to get into privilege associated with demographics such as [[Race|race]] or gender. That's an entirely separate matter.

- **[Noun]** a right or benefit that is given to some people and ==not to others==; **[Verb]** to give an advantage that ==others do not have== to (someone or something) &mdash; [Britannica Dictionary](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/privilege)
- **[Noun]** a special right or advantage that ==a particular person or group of people== has &mdash; [Oxford Learner's Dictionaries](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/privilege_1)
- **[Noun]** the power and advantage that only ==a small group of people have==, usually because of their wealth or their high social class; **[Verb]** to treat them better or ==differently than other people== or things rather than treat them all equally. &mdash; [Collins Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/privilege)
- **[Noun]** the special right that ==some people in authority have== that allows them to do or say things that ==other people are not allowed to== &mdash; [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/privilege)

I've omitted other descriptions for brevity. Follow those links if you'd like further definitions.

&nbsp;

My point in listing these definitions is to emphasize that a *privilege* isn't a word to describe what just any old clown off the street has the ability or authority to do. Having privilege over one's peers or contemporaries suggests exclusivity. Depending on context, it suggests to me that the privilege can be revoked. Abuse of privilege runs the risk that the privilege can be taken away.

&nbsp;

So... Ask yourself, then, if the LDS church would ever deign to turn away a monetary donation? If it would not, then paying tithing is *not a privilege*.

Speaking of...

&nbsp;
## Tithing
> *One of the blessings of membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is ==the privilege of paying tithing==. This privilege is a double blessing. By paying tithing, Church members show their gratitude to God for their blessings and their resolve to trust in the Lord rather than in material things. They also help further the work of the Lord in the earth, blessing others of God‚Äôs children with the opportunity to learn of Him and grow in the gospel.*

&nbsp;

> *Each morning we knelt together as a family, and each one in turn led our prayer. One memorable morning it was Mother‚Äôs turn. She described some of our immediate needs, and then she thanked our Heavenly Father for ==the privilege of living the law of tithing==. I immediately experienced a feeling of comfort and assurance. Living the law of the tithe was a privilege and would bring blessings. I did not doubt it because my mother knew it. Those feelings have remained and intensified throughout my life.*
> 
> ...
> 
> *You and I are now among those generations given the privilege to know and to live the law of the tithe.*

&nbsp;

I don't know about you, but if any other institution asked me for [[Tithing|10% of my income]] and pinky-promised that they were using the money for altruistic purposes (and definitely not amassing a [$200 billion stock portfolio](https://web.archive.org/web/20230716134241/https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/07/16/lds-church-its-way-becoming/),) and threatened to [separate me from my family for eternity](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/26-temple-recommends?lang=eng&id=p104-p105#p104) if I did not pay, I don't think I would call it a privilege. I think I'd call it extortion, or a scam.

&nbsp;

## Temple Garments
Imagine a parallel universe where *Fruit of the Loom* launches a new marketing campaign: "You might like other brands' products, but wearing our cotton briefs is *a privilege*. You don't want to squander that privilege, do you?"

Next imagine if a religious institution tried to pull that shit. Oh, hold on&mdash;you [[Garments|don't have to imagine it]].

&nbsp;

> *Each person should understand the importance of wearing the temple garment.*
> 
> *Explain that those who have participated in the temple ceremony are ==privileged== to wear the garment of the holy priesthood.*

&nbsp;

> *The First Presidency has stated, ‚Äú==It is a sacred privilege to wear the garment== and doing so is an ==outward expression of an inner commitment== to follow the Savior Jesus Christ.‚Äù*

&nbsp;

"Mm? What's that? You don't want to wear our proprietary underclothes that absolutely must be covered? Wait&mdash;don't rationalize why your dirty heathen ass doesn't like it, not yet&mdash;not until I remind you... that buying yeast-infection underpants exclusively from us is actually a *privilege*. Does that change your opinion on the matter?"

&nbsp;

## Other Privileges
What else does the LDS church call "a privilege"?

I think it'll be easier for everyone involved to just streamline my complaining into bullet lists.
