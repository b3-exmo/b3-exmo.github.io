# 👴 Russel M Nelson
## UNLEASHED
> *“I have seen him changing in the last ten months,” said Sister Nelson. “It is as though he’s been unleashed. He’s free to finally do what he came to earth to do. … ==And also, he’s free to follow through with things he’s been concerned about but could never do==. Now that he’s president of [the Church], he can do those things.”*

— *[Latter-day Saint Prophet, Wife and Apostle Share Insights of Global Ministry](https://web.archive.org/web/20250101170109/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/latter-day-saint-prophet-wife-apostle-share-insights-global-ministry)*, 30 October 2018 ([1](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/10/31/this-week-mormon-land/), [2](https://www.fox13now.com/2018/11/02/hes-been-unleashed-says-wendy-nelson-wife-of-russell-m-nelson-president-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints))

Damn, crazy how God’s ideals are always perfectly aligned with those ideals of whoever the current prophet is

&nbsp;

No joke, this was a really big [[Shelf|shelf item]] for me. This interview was given right when I hit my faith crisis. What I read from this quote is that the president of the LDS church is not acting in God's behalf. Things that President Nelson was quick to enact sound like things he'd been cooking up for years, *decades* possibly. We already have a precedent of Elder Russell Nelson suggesting [[Name Mormon#1990|we shouldn't call ourselves Mormons back in 1990]]. Isn't it just *wild* how God finally agreed with Nelson immediately after he was called to be the church president? God clearly [[Name Mormon#“I’m a Mormon” campaign|wasn't offended]] by the word "Mormon" during *any* prior church presidency.

To me, this calls into question how divinely inspired this man is—did God reveal things to Nelson twenty years in advance to just keep in his back pocket? And it becomes doctrinal once he outlives Thomas Monson? At the time of writing this note, Dallin Oaks is next in line. Has Oaks been receiving preemptive revelation before he can definitively say "now is the great day of my power. I rule from the rivers to the ends of the earth" and enact them? I'll be real, I kind of hope not.

And, just to make sure that you and I are on the same page&mdash;I am not interested in *ad hominem* smack-talk "this guy sucks and also is old" as an attitude here. At the time of writing, he's still alive at 100 years old. Irrespective of religious affiliation, respect where it's due for someone three times my age. I intend to criticize specific claims or qualities. No, I don't *like* Nelson, but I'm not here to make libelous allegations or defame him. 

&nbsp;

## Education
I intend to tread carefully here—not out of fear of reprisal from church members, but out of respect for someone's doctorate discipline. I have a bachelor's degree and I work with computers. I don't know jack shit about biology or cardiac surgery. I could talk for a good, long while about database engineering because that's what I studied in school, and is what I do as part of my career. I do not suggest that Dr. Nelson wasn't an educated surgeon.

What I mean to suggest instead is that Nelson seems to have internalized one of President Benson's *[[14 Fundamentals#5. The prophet is not required to have any particular earthly training or diplomas to speak on any subject or act on any matter at any time.|Fourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet]]*, where the acting president of the church doesn't need "any particular earthly training or diplomas to speak on any subject or act on any matter at any time." Nelson was, by my understanding, a successful *heart surgeon*. I believe that he can authoritatively talk to anyone *about heart surgery*.

Nelson has drawn on experience as a heart surgeon to authoritatively talk about things that are not heart surgery, and that's something that I take issue with. If we take President Benson's counsel at face value, there's no problem here. If we give critical evaluation to either of these men, we have problems.

&nbsp;

### Genetics
> ***Nelson:*** *We believe that God is our creator and that he has created other forms of life. It’s interesting to me, ==drawing on my 40 years experience as a medical doctor==, how similar those species are. We developed open-heart surgery, for example, experimenting on ==lower animals== simply because the same creator made the human being. We owe a lot to those ==lower species==. But to think that man evolved from one species to another is, to me, incomprehensible.*
> 
> ***\[Ruby\]:*** *Why is that?*
> 
> ***Nelson:*** *Man has always been man. Dogs have always been dogs. Monkeys have always been monkeys. ==It’s just the way genetics works==.*

— [In Focus: Mormonism in Modern America](https://web.archive.org/web/20241202040817/https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2007/05/16/in-focus-mormonism-in-modern-america/), Pew Research Center, 16 May 2007

I see a few issues here.

One, I don't think that actually *is* "the way genetics works."

Two, someone with *40 years experience* as a medical doctor should have a better understanding of "the way genetics works," and maybe shouldn't use the word "incomprehensible" to describe the generally accepted understanding of evolution.

Three, "lower animals/species" sounds like a very cavalier way of looking at God's creations. Didn't God charge mankind with stewardship over the Earth? The temple endowment ceremony says, by my recollection, "take good care of it." Nelson doesn't say that this surgical practice was a [vivisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivisection), but I have a hard time imagining what else it could be.

&nbsp;

> *==Evolution by natural selection is the most important scientific discovery of modern times== (I am stoically unapologetic about the lack of equivocation in that statement). The evidences for it are ==staggeringly abundant, detailed, and scientifically undeniable==. Our perspective of an open canon allows us to accept this new revelation from the book of nature without getting stuck in past pre-Darwinian quagmires. ==Mormons are all about continuing revelation. It’s what we do best.==*

— [Why Mormons Should Embrace Evolution: BYU Biology Professor Steven Peck](https://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/flunkingsainthood/2010/09/why-mormons-should-embrace-evolution-byu-biology-professor-steven-peck.html), Associate Professor of Biology at Brigham Young University, 20 September 2010

We could make the argument that a lowly associate professor's disposition holds less weight than a decorated doctor of heart surgery, who outlived contemporaries and became president of a church. We could also highlight that disparity in the opposite direction— an associate professor has a more grounded understanding of evolution than Nelson after a 40-year career.

&nbsp;

### Qualification
I've encountered the claim that Nelson "performed nearly 7,000 operations before his surgical career ended with the call to serve as an apostle." ([Who is President Russell M. Nelson? A man of heart, compassion and faith](https://web.archive.org/web/20241224222123/https://www.deseret.com/2018/1/16/20625383/who-is-president-russell-m-nelson-prophet-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-heart-surgeon/), Deseret News, Jan 15, 2021) Sure, I suppose I can take that at face value.

Nelson was called as an apostle in April 1984. ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1984/04/the-sustaining-of-church-officers?lang=eng&id=p11-p12#p11), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1984/04/call-to-the-holy-apostleship?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)) At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, he was `2020 - 1984 = 36` years displaced from practicing medicine. And yet folks will marvel at God's infinite wisdom in calling someone with medical background to lead the church during a pandemic.

Talk to someone who has worked as a CNA about how employable their medical work experience makes them if their certificate has been expired for *one week*. I'm very interested to know what they'll have to say.

2020 was somehow five years ago (at the time of writing this note,) meaning that Nelson is now *forty-one* years displaced from practicing medicine, and is still given credence on anything he has to say on the matter. I can't think of *any other context* where someone is treated as a subject matter expert after not working in an industry for forty goddamned years. What the fuck.

&nbsp;

## Who do we listen to?
> *Learn to listen, and listen to learn from neighbors. Repeatedly the Lord has said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour.” ==Opportunities to listen to those of diverse religious or political persuasion can promote tolerance and learning==. And a good listener will listen to a person’s sentiments as well.*

&nbsp;

> *There is no end to the adversary’s deceptions. Please be prepared. ==Never take counsel from those who do not believe==. Seek guidance from voices you can trust﻿—from prophets, seers, and revelators and from the whisperings of the Holy Ghost, who “will show unto you all things what ye should do.” Please do the spiritual work to increase your capacity to receive personal revelation.*

&nbsp;

🤷‍♂️ Listen to people who have the capacity to challenge your beliefs, but only up to the point that they actually do.

&nbsp;

## What has he done?
What good has Russel Nelson done for the world?

From the perspective of one outside the LDS church, what accomplishment or contribution from Nelson would you point to as an example of his prophetic authority?

From the perspective of an active, temple-recommend-holding LDS member, what makes Nelson meaningfully different from Monson, Hinckley, or Hunter?

From the perspective of a life-long traditional Catholic, what would draw your attention from the centralized theological authority in the Vatican to the one Salt Lake City?

&nbsp;

Nelson has announced numerous temples? Cool. Tell me more about that. I'm not trying to suggest that temples are a nonsensical waste of time&mdash;I am challenging the idea that we needed Russel Nelson to announce them.

If the "selling point" of having a living prophet, a spokesman for God, alive today in this dispensation, is that he leads and guides *us*, who are alive, here, today, living in 2025, then what in the jolly-good fuck is he doing announcing temples? Shouldn't he be, I don't know, *prophesying*? Telling us something meaningful from God? Temples primarily benefit those who have died. What about us who are still alive?

Anyone could announce temples. A delegated apostle or seventy could have done that. President Hinckley announced lots of temples. Did temple announcements somehow become *more important* since 2008, or 2018?

&nbsp;

## Pandemic Foresight
### 2019
If ever there was an opportunity for God to show *the entire world* that He has a living spokesperson on Earth, a prophet, seer, revelator, one who can see around corners, help guide the faithful, etc. *this was it*. We've got more practicing LDS faithful tuning in live to hear the prophet's divine wisdom than at any prior time, expecting leaders to share some insights, words of warning, assurance if it were nothing to fear, advice to prepare, *anything* would be a great chance to show that this church is led by God Himself.

What do we get instead?

&nbsp;

> *Now I would like to turn to another topic: plans for the coming year. ==In the springtime of the year 2020, it will be exactly 200== years since Joseph Smith experienced the theophany that we know as the First Vision. God the Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph, a 14-year-old youth. That event marked the onset of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, precisely as foretold in the Holy Bible.*
> 
> *...*
> 
> *Thus, the year 2020 will be designated as a bicentennial year. ==General conference next April will be different from any previous conference==. In the next six months, I hope that every member and every family will prepare for a unique conference that will ==commemorate the very foundations of the restored gospel==.*
> 
> *... As you [prepare], ==general conference next April will be not only memorable; it will be unforgettable==.*
> 
> *Now in closing, I leave with you my love and my blessing that each of you may become happier and holier with each passing day. Meanwhile, ==please be assured that revelation continues in the Church== and will continue under the Lord’s direction until “the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.”*

— *[Closing Remarks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/10/57nelson?lang=eng&id=p34,p38,p40-p41#p40)*, President Russell M. Nelson, General Conference 2019 October

&nbsp;

Yes, he uttered the words "general conference next April will be different from any previous conference." If you're going to be upset when someone "takes out of context" the vitriolic bullshit Brigham Young said when we extract one sentence from a paragraph, then I'll be equally upset when a sentence is extracted from the explicit and obvious context that Nelson was talking about the 200-year anniversary of the sanitized version of Joseph Smith's [[First Vision]]. Nelson could not have been more clear on what he meant.

&nbsp;

I can't demonstrate or prove this, but in the times when I've had missionaries over for their earnest attempts to re-activate me into fellowship, they've gleefully explained that this address was a prophetic warning about COVID-19. You can tell because Nelson said that next conference "will be different from any previous conference." I shit you not, this is what I've been told.

One could argue that, no, missionaries aren't an authoritative voice... unless you count that they're set apart for this specific calling, given ministerial licence, given priestly authority to follow Christ's charge to "preach to all nations," or... bah, you know what, missionaries are only authoritative when it's convenient for them to be. 

&nbsp;

### 2020
So what *did* happen in 2020?

> *My beloved brothers and sisters, as we welcome you to this historic April 2020 general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for reasons you know, I stand before you in an empty auditorium!*
> 
> *==Little did I know==, when I promised you at the October 2019 general conference that this April conference would be “memorable” and “unforgettable,” that speaking to a visible congregation of fewer than 10 people would make this conference so memorable and unforgettable for me! Yet the knowledge that you are participating by electronic transmission, and the choir’s beautiful rendition of “It Is Well with My Soul,” bring great comfort to my soul.*

— *[Opening Message](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/11nelson?lang=eng&id=p1-p3#p1)*, President Russell M. Nelson, General Conference April 2020

&nbsp;

We're told that prophets "[see around corners](https://speeches.byuh.edu/devotionals/prophets-can-see-around-corners)" which makes me think that revelation ought to be given proactively, rather than reactively. It makes me think that a prophet should not be surprised when general conference is held in an empty auditorium. It sounds even worse when that same prophet says "I had no idea this was going to happen lol"

*Read the rest of the paragraph*. Is there any modicum of an implication that Nelson is saying "this was in response to revelatory foreknowledge of COVID?" He's acknowledging in *explicit terms* that the promise of being memorable and unforgettable is in relation to the bicentennial anniversary of (the official, approved version of) the First Vision. No other year *can* be the 200th anniversary. It will be memorable because we're about to hear our fearless leaders *boldly proclaim* that it totally happened this way.

&nbsp;

#### Proclamation
> *==Two hundred years ago==, on a beautiful spring morning ==in 1820==, young Joseph Smith, seeking to know which church to join, went into the woods to pray near his home in upstate New York, USA. He had questions regarding the salvation of his soul and trusted that God would direct him.*
> 
> *...*
> 
> *==Two hundred years have now elapsed== since this Restoration was initiated by God the Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Millions throughout the world have embraced a knowledge of these prophesied events.*

— *[Proclamation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-restoration-of-the-fulness-of-the-gospel-of-jesus-christ/a-bicentennial-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng&id=p2,p4,p7#p2) that "was read by President Russell M. Nelson as part of his message at the 190th Annual General Conference, April 5, 2020, in Salt Lake City, Utah."*

&nbsp;

I don't know how else to interpret Nelson's claim that this conference would be unlike any other. It's the 200th anniversary of something that *[[First Vision|definitely happened in 1820]]* don't look into that claim please

Nelson wanted to make another formal *proclamation*, because he won't rest until he can one-up Hinckley at every opportunity. This is what Nelson was excited about, to make it memorable and unforgettable. It's 200 years after the canonized record of the First Vision.

&nbsp;

What a curious choice of words these selected paragraphs have. They didn't seem to mention that Joseph made absolutely no record of this world-changing event [[First Vision#Timeline of Accounts|for ten years]]—incidentally the same year that the LDS Church was [[Name Mormon#Name changes|founded]].

They did say in explicit terms that "God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, ==appeared== to Joseph[.]" The next sentence expounds on what happened "[i]n this ==vision==[.]" Makes me think that they're trying to equivocate around saying that Elohim and Jehovah both physically were present in Palmyra, New York, seeing how they are described as having "appeared" "in this vision." Not quite as bold and declarative as I'd have expected. I mean, that would imply that the [[Second Coming]] already happened, or else that the Second one [[Second Coming#How many times?|isn't actually the second]] appearance.

&nbsp;

Outside of nitpicking the vernacular, why was this proclamation necessary? The illustration "preaching to the choir" comes to mind. Who is for? A grand majority of folks tuning in to listen to this conference do so because they believe that the speakers are divinely inspired and authorized by God *because of the First Vision*. Nelson is assuring believers in the First Vision that the First Vision happened, which means that Nelson is authorized to speak for God.

If you'd like to postulate that this proclamation is meant for non-members, that's fine, but please—imagine this kind of proclamation from some other faith. If you were handed a printed proclamation by [David Miscavige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miscavige) asserting that the publication of [L. Ron Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard)'s *Dianetics* is a key historical event for the world, would you think "*by my troth*, this is all the definitive proof I needed! Sign me up for exorbitantly priced books, *post-haste*!" Or some similar publication from Bob Ciranko of JW's *Watchtower* reminding you that 144,000 individuals will be [[Sealing|sealed]] and "[are chosen](https://web.archive.org/web/20240503230238/https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004647#h=3) from among mankind to rule with Christ in heaven over the coming Paradise earth". Having read that in a formal proclamation issued by the upper echelons, would *that* sway your opinion of either group?

In either of these hypothetical scenarios, I might imagine why are these religious leaders proclaiming to the rest of the world? They're iterating a core belief that isn't new information. Most anyone familiar with Mormonism would know superficially about Joseph Smith claiming to have seen God and producing a text afterward. Imagine hearing Nelson's proclamation as a nonmember. What would you reaction be? Better yet— find a non-Mormon friend of yours and share it to them. How do they react? If it didn't soften their heart and get them to agree to baptism, then what was the point of the proclamation?

&nbsp;

Well, surely if Nelson hadn't used his prophetic mantle to warn us of COVID in 2019, maybe he did say something earlier?

&nbsp;

### Vitamins
*Eat your vitamin pills!* ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ClAOEkuYiM), [2](https://www.thechurchnews.com/2018/11/28/23264563/video-eat-your-vitamin-pills-get-your-rest-says-president-nelson-on-the-future-of-the-church/), [3](https://www.thechurchnews.com/living-faith/2023/9/22/23883693/sarah-jane-weaver-president-russell-nelson-invitation-eat-vitamin-get-some-rest-needed-now/), [4](https://www.deseret.com/2018/11/28/20659988/church-news-eat-your-vitamin-pills-get-your-rest-says-president-nelson-on-the-future-of-the-church/), [5](https://latterdaysaintmag.com/president-nelson-on-the-future-of-the-church-eat-your-vitamin-pills-get-your-rest-its-going-to-be-exciting/)) 

Really, though... Examine as many of those linked citations as you'd like. Read them and re-read them. Was there any hint, implication, or the mildest suggestion that there's an upcoming public health crisis?

Before you accuse me of being unfair by selecting a quote that wasn't presented over the pulpit, I will direct your attention to [Quentin Cook quoting Nelson's admonition](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/10/25cook?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) to take vitamins.

Former heart surgeon Russel Nelson was clearly called of God amid a pandemic, something that would require education in virology, microbiology, or [public health management](https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/index.html). I guess cardiac surgery is close enough. A non-specific vitamin will safeguard you. No, he won't tell you which one. This prophetic wisdom from November 2018 was all the counsel we needed.

What's that? He wasn't speaking as a prophet in those contexts? Boy, that'd be a real conundrum to find ourselves in— normally, whenever a prophet says something uncomfortable, we can rationalize that he was *speaking as a man* at that time. But a cardiac surgeon 34 years outside of practice talking about nutritional supplements? That was prophetic, no doubt. You need to stop looking at porn.

&nbsp;

### Come Follow Me
Alright, look... We got our church services 33% shorter to emphasize a more home-focused gospel study program. Is that a sign that God is involved in our lives, by preparing us for a pandemic via prophetic guidance?

I... *I guess*?

Put on your time-travel hat and think back to June 2018 when this program was announced. You'll have to imagine *real hard* because the church's website [now just redirects](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-announces-come-follow-me-for-home-sunday-school-and-primary?lang=eng) from the announcement to their Newsroom page, so we'll look at [the archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20201203231204/https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-announces-come-follow-me-for-home-sunday-school-and-primary?lang=eng) instead.

The newsroom article describes that this *Come, Follow Me* program is meant to "help Church members and their families study the scriptures at home." Starting in 2019, we'll have a unified schedule for lessons. Neat.

So... Read through as much of this article as you have patience for. While you're there, tell me what part you saw as related to a global pandemic upending the world's economy. Maybe I'm just a miserable grump, but I don't see *jack shit* in here about an upcoming pandemic.

If you'd like to draw the connection that at-home scripture study is indicative that people will be heavily encouraged to stay in their homes as prophetic foresight, then... I don't know, man, if that's where you're going, I just don't know what to tell you. Pause and think if that leap of logic would stand under scrutiny of any of your non-religious peers or friends. Find a neutral third-party, and ask "hey, imagine a hypothetical organization's leader cutting a physical gathering's duration by one hour and providing a structured at-home study program beginning in 2019. Do you think that's divine insight? Would you understand that to be a forewarning of COVID-19? Is that indicative that this leader is led by God?" Straight up, ask someone this, and tell me what their response is.

#### Children and Youth
> *The Church will discontinue its participation in Scouting on December 31, 2019, and the Personal Progress, Duty to God, and Faith in God programs will be discontinued on that date.*

&nbsp;

Yeah, man. "Designed especially for you and your generation[.]" To be launched weeks before the world shuts down, and our kids & teenagers will do absolutely fuck-all with it because they won't meet in-person for months, or even years.

Was *Come, Follow Me* inspired and timely in anticipation of at-home study due and pandemic lockdowns? Then tell me how this other program, explicitly described as being designed for *these kids at this time*, was... maybe *not* divinely inspired?

*You can't have it both ways.*

&nbsp;

### Meaningful hypothetical
So what would have been a useful message to receive in 2018 or 2019?

&nbsp;

Is the LDS church led by God? The prophet outlined an at-home study program to prepare for a global pandemic instead of doing *fucking anything else* that would help the world with what they were actually worried about. For being a stone cut out of a mountain, rolling until it fills the whole earth, unstoppable by any unhallowed hand, the [LDS church's membership](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics) still only makes up a comically small proportion of the [world's population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/): `17,225,394 ÷ 8,209,267,657 = 0.21%`

I'm sure the remaining 99.8% of the world is glad that God's one true prophet warned 0.2% of the world about a pandemic by giving them a study manual. 

&nbsp;

Let's run through a thought exercise. Let's imagine that *you* are the prophet. Imagine that God advises you that PPE will be in high demand, supply chains will be disrupted and lead to food shortages, a communicable disease will cause nations to shut down their borders, and the world will be conflicted about who is an authoritative voice through it all. What would you do? What would you tell people?

Would you decide that the only necessary prep work in anticipation of people desperately seeking guidance and assurance is that they should go to church for 2 hours instead of 3? Would you decide to announce that the next session of General Conference will "be different from any previous conference" because of a bicentennial anniversary of an event with dubious documentation?

&nbsp;

Consider these options, in response to this hypothetical scenario:

- Make a strong reminder about the practice of food storage, supplies, emergency preparedness; de-emphasized in recent years
- Tell adherents (or the whole world) to get debts and finances in order in anticipation of financial hardship and uncertainty
- Donate some funds from your $150 billion stock portfolio to provide hospitals with PPE
- Use funds from that investment portfolio to stockpile PPE in anticipation of supply shortages 
- Switch the temple garment manufacturing to produce PPE well in advance
- Leverage medical credentials and connections to virologists to begin developing a vaccine years in advance
- Advise leadership of any scale (church congregations, states, nations) how to contain the spread, if only just to reduce panic
- Announce in 2019 that 2020's general conference session will be entirely online, as to dissuade people from wasting time and money on flights and travel arrangements
- Call all full-time missionaries home by the end of 2019, and stop sending out new ones

"oh, but President Nelson didn't want to scare everyone" *shut the fuck up* What was scary was society collapsing, having no idea who to trust, hearing about hundreds of thousands of deaths while you're trapped in your home, and hearing a quorum of fifteen prophets of God saying "idk lol" because if there was ever a time for *one human* to authoritatively speak in behalf of God, it would have been *very timely* for him to talk in April 2020 about something other than Joseph Smith's First Vision.

"Corrupt government officials wouldn't listen anyway" yeah? Is it because the church hasn't had anything meaningful to say outside of "Jesus good, porn bad?" Even if government officials didn't listen at the outset, they could have had a clear record that "those oddballs in Utah had a lot of this figured out months in advance, maybe we should listen to them in the future."
