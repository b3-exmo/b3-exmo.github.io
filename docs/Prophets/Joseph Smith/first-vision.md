# 🕶 First Vision
> *In the spring of 1820, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith as he prayed in a grove of trees near his home in western New York. This event is known as the ==First Vision==.*

&mdash; *[First Vision](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/first-vision?id=p1&lang=eng#p1)*, Topics and Questions

&nbsp;

> *Our whole strength rests on the validity of that [first] vision. ==It either occurred or it did not occur==. If it did not, then this work is a fraud. If it did, then it is the most important and wonderful work under the heavens.*

— *[The Marvelous Foundation of our Faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2002/10/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith?lang=eng)*, President Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference October 2002

🤔

&nbsp;

Put simply, there are multiple accounts of Joseph Smith's First Vision. At face value, repeating a story to increase exposure and communicate to a broader audience makes sense. ==This would be a non-issue== if the story being told was consistent. I should expect that this story is one that does not allow any room for discrepancy. The timeline of these accounts is absolutely worth considering. Reportedly, it took place in 1820. The LDS church was formally founded in 1830. The earliest documented appearance of this story is 1832. The earliest record of the First Vision being actively propagated is in *1839*. This means that by the time *most* LDS church members will have heard about this critical, foundational event, it will have been *nineteen years* past.

Between 1820 and 1832 (a *twelve year gap*) there is not a single mention of Joseph Smith having witnessed any kind of divine intervention. Between the church's founding and the earliest record of the First Vision is a stint of two years, give or take some months&mdash;and that record is in Joseph's personal journal. Prior to 1839, scarce citations exist of the First Vision. Anyone joining the church in this *nine year* window of time will not have the context nor even a notion that this church was *[[Restoration|restored]]*, or is in contrast to apostasy. This is reflected in sermons given decades later, when early converts who become figureheads like George Q Cannon, Orson Pratt, even Brigham Young actively try to shut down this *crazy rumor* floating around that God appeared to Brother Joseph. Yes, [[first-vision-pt2#Early Church Leaders|I have receipts]] to back up that assertion.

&nbsp;

I'll demonstrate here why I believe this is a problem. If we heed the words of modern-day prophets, this either happened or it didn't, and there is no room for middle ground. If it didn't happen, "then this work is a fraud." I've got a link above to the General Conference talk where Gordon B. Hinckley says this. Go on and read the talk if I'm somehow taking that quote out of context.

&nbsp;

## Significance
If the First Vision didn't happen, then Joseph Smith did not restore Christ's church. If Joseph Smith did not restore Christ's church, what is this organization?

If God hadn't personally appeared to advise Joseph directly that all other churches were incorrect, then Joseph is just adding to the confusion by making one more flavor of Christianity. If we were to argue that Joseph became a prophet later than 1820, then *that* would be the selling point that missionaries tell their ~~investigators~~ "friends" about on the first lesson. In my experience as a missionary for the LDS church, I was required to recite the 1838 account from memory on demand. And *that's what I did*. Imagine my dismay when, after reciting this to however many dozens or hundreds of people, I find that this theophany wasn't as clear-cut and simple as I had been told.

&nbsp;

## Timeline
For whatever reason, there's an uncomfortably long span of time between God Himself appearing to mankind, and that event being recorded.

In some, but not all of Joseph Smith's records (minimum twelve years displaced) he mentions how no one believes his story. That is a relevant factor, for sure&mdash;assuming someone had believed him, they would likely have written it in their journal, or bantered in a newspaper column, something like "that Smith boy told me the darndest thing the other day!" or "this little fella told me that God appeared to him. Fancy that! We should listen to other things he has to say." I'll explain in [[first-vision-pt2#Similar accounts|more detail later]], but this absence of records might have had something to do with God appearing to *so many other people* in New England in the early 19th century. 

*Joseph's story wasn't unique*&mdash;a typical response wouldn't be "wow, God appeared to you in the woods with no other witnesses around? Fascinating, tell me more!" it would instead be "ugh, you too?" Assuming Joseph did tell people, that was such a common claim that his story wouldn't have been notorious to anyone. Not even Joseph's own family wrote down anything of the sort until after 1838. They did write about it, but only after Joseph canonically retrofitted it into the context of his church's founding. I might expect to see in his siblings' journals "my dork-ass brother says he saw God. Isn't that inspiring / preposterous / blasphemous / evidentiary / breathtaking  / absurd / exciting?" Instead I find... nothing.

&nbsp;

What we do have, though, are scans of Joseph Smith's own personal journal where [[Book of Abraham#Written by whom?|written by his own hand]] is his accounting of the First Vision. This is the record dated closest to the actual event, so one might think that it holds more gravitas than the others. Let's give it a look-see, shall we?

&nbsp;

### 1832
Summer of 1832 is the *first recorded mention* of the first vision. I cannot understate how this was written **two years after** the church was founded, and ***twelve years after*** the vision reportedly happened.

You can read it for yourself from an official publication on the LDS church's site: under its Library > Books and Lessons > Church History - Resources > First Vision > [Circa Summer 1832 History](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1832-account?lang=eng). <br>
It can also be found in the *Joseph Smith Papers Project* [here](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1). Actually, please do go look at the original scans, because it sure looks to me like the pages are held in with tape. Almost as if the pages had at one point been torn out from the book at one point...

&nbsp;

I'll share a bullet list of notorious features in this account:

- Joseph is fifteen years old ("in the 16th year of my age")
- Joseph was not asking which church to join
- Joseph already concluded that all other churches were false
- Joseph "cried unto the Lord for mercy\[;\]" Motivation for praying was existential
- No attack by Satan
- The Lord appeared, forgave Joseph's sins
- The Lord verified that other churches were false, and He doesn't like that very much

... and that's pretty much it.

&nbsp;

This is the earliest accounting of the First Vision and it's notably different from what later becomes canonized. We'll examine discrepancy later, but wouldn't you think that the account closest to the actual event would be most accurate?

Problems arise if we give this account (written by Joseph Smith himself, no scribe this time) any real consideration. If God didn't appear to advise Joseph that other churches were wrong, and simply forgave his sins, would any of us be talking about it 200 years later?

In fact, this is such a theological outlier, that we shouldn't be surprised to find that a certain church historian cut the pages out of Joseph's journal to make the remaining accounts internally consistent. [[first-vision-pt2#Scanned Papers|More on that later]].

&nbsp;

### 1835
Read it for yourself!
Library > Books and Lessons > Church History - Resources > First Vision > [Journal, 9–11 November 1835](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1835-account?lang=eng)
*Joseph Smith Papers Project*: [Journal, 1835–1836](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/25)

&nbsp;

Summary:<br>
- Joseph is "\[a\]bout 14 years old"
- Joseph resolves that "I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences"
- Joseph prays seeking information on who was right
- Unable to verbally pray in first attempts; no explanation why
- *Two* personages appear; the second forgives Joseph's sins
- Personage "testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God"
- Also lots of angels

&nbsp;

Now we've got *two* divine figures.

![[now-there-are-two.gif]]{: .center .size40}

&nbsp;

Tally of factors consistent between these two accounts:

- Joseph prayed
- A divine figure forgives Joseph's sins
<br>
&nbsp;

Tally of factors *inconsistent* between these two accounts:

- Age
- Motivation (existential vs. "I should pick the right one")
- Context of prayer (all churches are already wrong; now which one is right?)
- Number of divine figures appearing (one vs. two plus many angels)
- Response of the divine figure(s)
<br>
&nbsp;

I don't feel like we're off to a good start. We're only two accounts in, and the story has already changed enough that I'd begin to question A) if this happened, and B) if it matters. God (or maybe not God) appeared and forgave your sins. *Hot dog*, I require no further assurance of this man's divine appointment to be a prophet!

&nbsp;

### 1838
Library > Scriptures > Pearl of Great Price > Joseph Smith—History [1:4-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=5-20#4)
*Joseph Smith Papers Project*: [History, circa June 1839–circa 1841, Draft 2](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2?p=2)

&nbsp;

Here's the officially sanctioned version. It's much more verbose, and is the one I was drilled on in the mission field, the one found in Preach My Gospel, and canonized in scripture. You didn't ask for it, but I will emphasize again the ==eighteen year gap== between this account and the date it happened.

Summary:<br>
- Joseph was in his "fifteenth year;" "... early spring of 1820"
- Joseph's mind was greatly excited by religious debate
- Joseph isn't sure if truth is to be found. If so, where? Let's pray and find out
- Joseph was "seized upon by some power," "thick darkness gathered," felt "doomed to sudden destruction"
- Two personages appear; one introduces the other as "my beloved Son"
- Jesus (presumably) answered that Joseph "must join none of them"
- "[[Book of Mormon#Cannot be written|and many other things did he say unto me which I cannot write at this time]]."

&nbsp;

Something I find suspicious about this account is Joseph's response to the words spoken directly from the mouth of God Himself.... assuming this is God appearing.

God says "this is my beloved son, hear Him," and Joseph's reaction is, and I quote, "No sooner ... did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right... and which I should join."

Just feels out of place to me. God appears and says "listen up! Jesus is talking." and Joseph immediately cuts Him off, "hold on, hooolld up right there, I have questions first!"

🤔

&nbsp;

Tally of factors consistent across all three of these accounts:

- Joseph prayed

&nbsp;

I'll show a comparison of inconsistencies after the fourth account to avoid redundancy.

&nbsp;

### 1842
How does the story develop ***twenty-two years*** after the fact?

Library > Books and Lessons > Church History - Resources > First Vision > [“Church History,” 1 March 1842 (Wentworth Letter)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1842-account?lang=eng)
*Joseph Smith Papers Project*: [“Church History,” 1 March 1842](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/church-history-1-march-1842/1?p=1)

&nbsp;

Summary:<br>
- Joseph is "about fourteen years of age"
- Joseph sees "the importance of being prepared for a future state," and finds conflicting claims between churches
- Joseph prays to ask for clarification
- No resistance or difficulty in praying
- While "enwrapped in a heavenly vision," saw two identical personages
- "They told me that all religious denominations" were incorrect 
- "The fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me."

&nbsp;

### Comparison
Tally of factors consistent across all four of these accounts:

- Joseph prayed

&nbsp;

Comparison of factors *inconsistent* between all four accounts (and please remember that the church was founded in 1830):

&nbsp;

Man, get your story straight.

Imagine hearing someone tell you that "God appeared to me fifteen years ago! No, I didn't tell anyone at the time. I mean, maybe it wasn't *God*, but Jesus was there. Kind of, one figure testifies *of* Jesus, but neither really told me explicitly who they were. Though maybe there was only one figure who showed up. Don't remember for sure, but there was definitely at least one personage in a pillar of light! Anyway, they told me that you're wrong, but didn't exactly say what was right. No, nobody else was around to corroborate this."

The next week, you hear this same guy sadly lamenting "no one believes my story 🥺"

i fucken wonder why

&nbsp;

## Problems
To be clear, ==there are more than four accounts==, but these four are the ones described in both the LDS church site's [gospel topics essay](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng) and [JSPP's plaintext presentation](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/articles/primary-accounts-of-first-vision?lang=eng) on the differing accounts. Go on and read through that essay if you'd like to compare these accounts with a more charitable outlook. JSPP's document there simply shows them in modernized English, making them more palatable with things like sentence structure. On the [[first-vision-pt2|part two]] page of notes (the rambling will continue until morale improves) I've got an examination of [[first-vision-pt2#Improvement Era|eight different "official" accounts]]. Two would be enough for me to begin to doubt. 

&nbsp;

At the risk of belaboring a point too much, the *first* recorded account was ***twelve years*** after the fact. I keep bringing this up because *this is not a small problem*. Instead, it is what we in the industry call "a big problem." No documentary evidence is to be found prior to 1832 that anyone had even heard Joseph talk about this. No documentary evidence demonstrates that Joseph had preached or shared this message until 1840. And, again, this earliest account wasn't the first printed and distributed account&mdash;I've seen claims that this was either in 1840 or 1842. You know, ten to twelve years after the church was founded. 

&nbsp;

### Memory
We can try to explain away the discrepancies by observing that memory falters over time. After all, I think that you and I can agree that ==memory does not get better with time==. Unless, of course, you're in charge of writing an apologetic essay for the LDS church, then details changing over time proves that they're true. [I am not kidding](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng&id=p16#p16), that is what their essay describes.

What role *should* memory play in determining the accuracy of First Vision accounts? I would think that the version recorded closest to the date of the event would be least tarnished by entropy. I would also think that the version recorded in Joseph's own handwriting would make it non-repudiable, and yet it's the most *dramatically different* outlier. We can't blame scribes for misquoting Joseph if he wrote down his own experience with his own hands. Why, then, have we disregarded these factors in deciding which version is canon? The church settled on the account recorded eighteen years after the event, ignoring the one that the prophet wrote by his own hand. 

&nbsp;

I really don't think that "[[i-forgor.jpg|i forgor 💀]]" is a good explanation for omitting the presence of God. Adding that critical detail years later makes it sounds like the story is fabricated. In fact, I will argue that the (hypothetical) memory of *God Himself* appearing to me after grappling with supernatural Satanic bindings, and then hearing God answer the questions I had been ruminating over for years would be *an event that you don't just forget*.

If we can agree that memory degrades over time, then Joseph's memory twelve to eighteen years after the event makes the later recollections less reliable, and that makes the earliest account of the experience the most reliable. If the earliest account is the most reliable, then it has no bearing on the formation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. All that meaningfully happened in the 1832 account is Joseph was forgiven of sins. *That's it*. [[#1832|Go re-read it again]] and tell me if I missed some detail.

&nbsp;

### Age
You'll likely notice that the comparison of *Age* has only minor variation. I'm not trying to require that Joseph be able to describe down to the day precisely how old he was, but please recognize that despite the tremendous weight of the moment when divine figures appeared to Joseph, in no account does he narrow down when this happens. The closest we get is "spring of 1820."

The problem isn't that I can't find a definitive date for the First Vision. The problem is that Joseph can't consistently tell us anything specific about what *would be* among the most monumental events in human history. If I had a specific date, that wouldn't make things more palatable&mdash;the problem is that if this event mattered to him, Joseph would recollect vivid details about the day when the entirety of his worldview changed because *fucking God Himself showed up* to advise the prophet that no other church is true, which means that the eternal salvation of *every human alive in that moment* is in jeopardy, and it's up to this teenaged farmboy to restore the gospel as Christ Himself taught it, but he can't even remember when that happened. Some time in the spring when he was "about fourteen" is the best we get.

&nbsp;

In some accounts, Joseph will say he's "in his fifteenth year" or some variation. I don't think that phrasing lends to discrepancy. To us in the 21st century, it sounds odd, but to be "fourteen years old" suggests fourteen birthdays to have elapsed. We normally count age from 0, so to speak; we've had zero birthdays in our first year of life, so being in his sixteenth year would put him at fifteen years old.

Sounds funny, but I don't see it as a problem.

&nbsp;

Joseph can point to specific dates for *other* milestone events ([Aaronic priesthood restoration](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/foundations-of-the-restoration-teacher-manual/lesson-5-the-restoration-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&id=p1#p1), [church founding](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-6-april-1830-dc-21/1), [Kirtland temple dedication](https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/content/library/kirtland-temple-dedicatory-prayer-1836?lang=eng), [Nauvoo Expositor being destroyed](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/mayors-order-to-nauvoo-city-marshal-10-june-1844/2), [re-sealing dates for extramarital wives](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/event/js-sealed-again-to-emily-and-eliza-partridge), [sections in the Doctrine & Covenants](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/chron-order?lang=eng)) but, wouldn't you know it, the one event that would render all others worthless if it lost credibility? No idea when it happened. Spring sometime, he was like 14 or something, who knows.

I can tell you the specific dates of some key events in my life, many of which revolve around the LDS church: my baptism date, the day I went to get temple endowments, the day I went to the *Missionary Training Center* in Provo, the day I got married in the Salt Lake City temple, and the day I started my career job after graduating university. Each of those dates are important to me. None of those events are as consequential as God appearing to tell me that every variety of Christianity is wrong, and how much that pisses Him off (as shown in the 1832 account.)

&nbsp;

Did God appear to you or not, Joseph? Did you forget what God said to you eighteen years later? You didn't write it down the day of? Do we not recognize the significance of God appearing&mdash;not a pastor, not a warm-fuzzy-feeling spirit, not an angel in a dream&mdash;*God the Father* appeared, and you didn't write down what He said to you? It'd sure look bad if you had to tell people about this twenty two years after the fact and have to just shrug your shoulders and say "yeah, God appeared, said you were wrong, and maybe He'd tell me the truth later idk lol"

The reason why fussing over how old Joseph was is two-fold: he should be able to remember how old he was in a formative memory, and he should be able to identify the date of something as monumental as Elohim showing up for tea. If Joseph can't tell you when it happened, then it must not have been that formative, monumental, or important. And if *this of all things* wasn't important enough to remember, then I'm going to assert that it didn't happen. And if it didn't happen... well, President Hinckley himself presented the duality that "then this work is a fraud."

&nbsp;

### Personages
Who are these personages?

In 1832, Joseph "saw the Lord." The personage does say He is "the Lord of glory" and was crucified. Joseph seemed to hold a [[Changes#Godhead|trinitarian view]] at this point, so that title could be either Jehovah or Elohim to us. Unclear to me which one.

In 1835, Joseph "called on the Lord in mighty prayer." Two personages appear. One forgives Joseph's sins, and the same one testifies of Jesus. I am left to wonder if this means that Jesus testified of Jesus, or if Elohim Himself testified of His son to Joseph, if the silent personage was Jesus and the one speaking was... someone else, or if Jesus was present at all. They're only identified as identical personages. How insightful is this account?

In 1838, I think it's safe to conclude that it's God the Father and Jesus Christ appearing. It isn't explicit, but I don't see a lot of room for alternative interpretation in this account.

In 1842, Joseph "began to call upon the Lord" and "saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other." They said to not join a church. No hints or clues as to who they are.

&nbsp;

How many were there?

If *you*, reader, if *you* saw God the Father and Jesus Christ both physically present in front of you, do you think that you would think back on the event and mistake them for:

- Just Jesus
- An angelic visitor (singular)
- Multiple angels
<br>
&nbsp;

This is not a detail you misremember. If you fucking *saw God* then you don't fumble that memory. You weren't counting how many fast-food workers were assembling a hamburger. You weren't trying to recall how many other passengers were on the bus. You were alone in the woods with an otherworldly pillar of light, and saw *how many personages*? One? Two plus "many angels"? Actually just two? If your recollection on seeing God falters, then *maybe you didn't actually see God*.

&nbsp;

### Intent
==In 1832==, Joseph wrote that before he prayed he already knew that there was no true living faith or denomination as established by Jesus in the New Testament. Instead, the explicitly stated purpose in praying was to seek forgiveness. Nothing to do with [James 1:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5). Joseph wasn’t even asking about which church to join&mdash;he had already concluded that they were wrong.

> *… by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatised from the true and liveing faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament.*

&nbsp;

That isn't something you misremember. You're not going to change your reasons for prayer from "I know the answer, though I'll pray for forgiveness" to "I don't know the answer, so I'll pray to find out." 

That is not a small discrepancy.

&nbsp;

==In 1838==, the canonized account presents a very different intent:

> *My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join"..."(for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)*

&nbsp;

Six years after the prior telling, Joseph's reason for praying to God changes completely. Not only does the first account mention *none of this*, it describes the *opposite*. They can’t both be right. They’re in direct contradiction to each other. Get your story straight, Joseph.

&nbsp;

Think of it this way: assuming you, reader, are or were an actively practicing member of the LDS faith, think back to the time when you gained your spiritual confirmation of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. Was it in your room? Chapel? Temple grounds? Did you follow [[Cognitive Bias#Moroni's Promise|Moroni's promise]] as directed by the missionaries? Did you "ask God with real intent?" Did you get the warm-fuzzy feeling?

You don't have to tell me any level of detail for this experience&mdash;it is your own to share or protect, but think on that recollection for context or surrounding information. Don't feel pressured to tell me anything that you don't want to tell me.

... Are you really sure you were praying to know if the Book of Mormon was true? Are you sure you weren't just praying for forgiveness, and *then* felt that the book was true? Hadn't you actually concluded that there was no "true" religious texts, so you were asking God what to do?

That's the kind of mental gymnastics I'm seeing in Joseph's experience. His intention behind going into the woods to pray has such variance for an unforgettable theophany that I truly don't feel convinced that this holds up under scrutiny.

### Trinitarianism
> *There are two personages who constitute the great matchless, governing and supreme power over all things—by whom all things were created and made, that are created and made, whether visible or invisible: whether in heaven, on earth, or in the earth, under the earth, or throughout the immensity of space—They are the Father and the Son: ==The Father being a personage of spirit==, glory and power: possessing all perfection and fulness: The Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle, made, or fashioned like unto man, or being in the form and likeness of man, or, rather, man was formed after his likeness, and in his image[.]*

&mdash; *[Lecture Fifth](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835/61)*, Lectures on Faith Section V, paragraph 2, page 53; Doctrine and Covenants, ==1835==, The Joseph Smith Papers

&nbsp;

Boy, for someone who definitely saw God in a physical manifestation fifteen years prior, Joseph's foundational theological documents sure don't seem to know if God has a body or if He is "a personage of spirit." It'd be pretty awkward if this understanding of God as being intangible [[Changes#Godhead|persisted into printing the Book of Mormon]]. That might cast some doubt on the legitimacy of Joseph's theophany or of his translated work of scripture, or whether God is eternal & unchanging or not. If only God had called a prophet who could clarify this for us 🤔

&nbsp;

The above quote is found in a publication of the *Book of Commandments* containing the *Lectures on Faith*, where Joseph Smith and his other contemporaries in church leadership establish foundational doctrine and theology. Not only does it identify God as "a personage of spirit," but this would be a *perfect* opportunity to posit that our church's founding prophet literally *saw God and Jesus* physically manifested. Is that in there?

Nope. Doesn't even mention in passing that Joseph had anything like a First Vision. Would be a prime opportunity to even demonstrate the prophet's experience in 1820 of seeking mercy and receiving forgiveness, and maybe something about truth. Would also be a good time to demonstrate that God has a physical body and is actively participating in ensuring we have a shot at salvation by physically appearing to call a prophet.

&nbsp;

### Result
If we set aside the discrepancy in *when* this event happened, *why* it happened, *who* was present, or *whether* it can be reliably told, we still really do need to examine what the result was. What happened, if anything? A heavenly messenger appeared to Joseph. What did they say?

Whether personally or through some intermediary, God answers Joseph's question. Some permutation of the following interactions happened, then:

| Year     | Query                                                          | Reply                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1832** | I'm bummed out about sins. Show me some mercy?                 | 👌 sure thing, your sins are forgiven. bye                           |
| **1835** | I want to make sure I join the right church. Which is right?   | Your sins are forgiven. Jesus is the son of God, btw                 |
| **1838** | Not sure if *any* of the churches are right? What should I do? | Don't join one. Also don't write down anything else that I tell you. |
| **1842** | Religion seems important, but is confusing. What should I do?  | Don't join one. I'll tell you later what to do.                      |

I'll be real, I don't know which of those responses I find more dissatisfying. Why would God answer Joseph's specific question of "which church is right" with "I'll tell you later"? That's heavily paraphrased, of course, but God and Joseph are literally in physical proximity, face to face&mdash;one of them is eternal and omniscient, and the other is asking for advice. If God answered your question that way, how would you react? "Well, golly gee, if only I had someone all-knowing with infinite wisdom physically manifest Himself before me, an event with remarkably few recorded instances throughout all of Earth's existence, who was capable of providing an answer for which church to join. Oh wait, I have literally the creator of all of fathomable reality right in front of me." What the hell, God?

&nbsp;

### Publications
No records pertaining to the founding of the LDS church mention that one time Brother Joseph saw God, and God telling him that other churches were wrong and to found a new one to "restore" the original. In fact, the opposite is shown; demonstrated [[#Trinitarianism|above]], the early LDS church leadership under Joseph's guidance stuck with trinitarianism, and that God is "a personage of spirit."

Outside the context of a church being founded, the 10 year gap between 1820 and 1830 has no indication that it ever happened. No contemporary periodicals in that ten year span mention Joseph Smith. Actually, they do, but they're talking about things like Joseph defrauding people rather than seeing God's physical body, but that's for a different page of notes. None of the publications in that decade, and no journal nor correspondence from that time mentions Joseph Smith's First Vision. ... There are extant records of "first visions" from *other* people, though. [[first-vision-pt2#Similar accounts|We'll get to it]].

&nbsp;

The first periodical to be published by the Church was *The Evening and Morning Star*, ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evening_and_the_Morning_Star), [2](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/28104), [3](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/The_Evening_and_The_Morning_Star/1/1), [4](https://archiveviewer.org/collections/en/the-evening-and-the-morning-star)) but to my knowledge it never tells the story of the First Vision. Nor does the Latter-day Saints *Messenger and Advocate*, ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_and_Advocate), [2](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/7160), [3](https://archiveviewer.org/collections/en/latter-day-saints-messenger-and-advocate)) printed in Kirtland. In this newspaper Oliver Cowdery, who was second only to Joseph Smith in the early organization of the Church, published letters concerning the origin of the Church. These letters were written and published with the approval of Joseph Smith, but again, they contained no mention of any vision.

The first *printing* that I'm aware of for the First Vision was by [Orson Pratt in 1840](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/appendix-orson-pratt-an-interesting-account-of-several-remarkable-visions-1840/5), in which neither personage is identified at Heavenly Father or Jesus Christ.

&nbsp;

Must not have been all that important, then.

... If it wasn't important, then did it happen?
