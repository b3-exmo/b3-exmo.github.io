# 😍 Joseph Smith
How much rationalization has to occur in an LDS believers mind to still see Joseph Smith as a Prophet of God? How many times do we have to cut him a break?

The notes here will be focusing more on Joseph's problems, flaws, and shortcomings. This does not mean that Joseph was a villainous miscreant rapscallion. ==Humans are complicated creatures, and Joseph Smith is a human==. I had nearly 30 years of focusing solely and exclusively on Joseph's positive qualities, his wins, his successes, and theological contribution. ==There are good things to be said about him==, but I won't focus on them here. I had plenty of indoctrination on how noble and great Joseph was. If you'd like to hear about Smith's positive qualities, I could point you to some folks [who absolutely love talking about that](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/contact-us). The purpose of this compendium of notes is for me to organize my thoughts and findings.

I'll reveal part of my thought process here: flaws give depth to character. The shiny, clean, presentable image of any historical figure is frankly quite boring. A character in a fictional story who is good at everything, has no challenges, always wins and everyone agrees with is not a compelling story. A representation of history where the figure in question is suave and diplomatic, wins every battle, is skilled at everything, and always overcomes obstacles feels dishonest.

Life isn't like that. Slavery abolitionist [John Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)) is a fascinating historical figure to read about because of the opposition he faced and overcame, which was pretty clearly documented. The version of Joseph Smith that I grew up with is that he was always right, inspired of God, got persecuted by ne'er-do-wells, brought about the fullness of Christ's church, and clearly did a great job of it because it's still around today, 200 years later. 

As an adult, I'm finding out about domestic disputes with Emma, evolving theology, and actual reasons for being incarcerated that are more profound than "[[Satan]] make bad thing happen to Jesus-man". 

To me, these negative aspects make Smith feel more like a real human, rather than an idealized, romanticized image of 19th century frontier living. Reality isn't so polished and presentable, and I'm skeptical of presentations of history that sound too good to be true. If a 19th century figure doesn't have at least one relative that died of tuberculosis or by shitting themselves to death, I am not going to believe the story. Life was rough back then, and I expect presentation to reflect that.

## Lucy Mack Smith
I don't have much to say about Lucy as an individual. Most of what I find online is that she was the first woman to give a general conference address ([1](https://www.ldsliving.com/the-first-time-a-woman-spoke-in-general-conference-lucy-mack-smiths-powerful-talk-from-1845/s/84948), [2](https://www.churchhistorianspress.org/at-the-pulpit/part-1/chapter-5?lang=eng), [3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/womens-voices-past-and-present-impact-general-conference-and-the-church-for-good?lang=eng)). 

> Lucy Mack Smith was the first woman to give a general conference talk. In October 1845, she shared “This Gospel of Glad Tidings to All People.” The talk illustrated some of the struggles she faced with her husband and children, and she gave the powerful advice, “Be good and kind and do in secret as you would do in the presence of millions.”
>
> ==After Lucy Mack Smith, women didn’t regularly speak in the general sessions again until April 1984== when Elaine A. Cannon, Barbara B. Smith, Barbara W. Winder, and Ardeth G. Kapp each shared their testimonies over the pulpit.

— *[How the General Conference Women's Meeting has Evolved Over the Years](https://www.ldsliving.com/how-the-general-conference-womens-meeting-has-evolved-over-the-years/s/89366)*, LDSLiving

Boy, that... that 139 year gap is not something to just sweep under the rug like that. I haven't examined those addresses in '84, but based on that quote, should I assume they were simply testimonies rather than authoritative speeches?

I did find a [list of women who have participated](https://www.churchhistorianspress.org/at-the-pulpit/reference/appendix?lang=eng) in General Conferences in the past. It doesn't quite line up with the above quote, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

### Joseph Jr's Upbringing
What I find more fascinating about Lucy is her account of Joseph Jr's upbringing.

Lucy tells that Joseph had a great interest in the “ancient inhabitants” of this continent and that before he “translated” the Book of Mormon he used to entertain the family with stories about them:

> _“He would describe … their dress, mode of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their buildings, with every particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life among them”_

— History of Joseph Smith by His Mother, 1954 ed., p. 83; copied from [http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changech5b.htm](http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changech5b.htm)

This source is particularly noteworthy because it is only obtainable by Deseret Book, owned by the church itself. That in itself lends credibility to it- LDS church wouldn’t perpetuate bad history, would it? What further lends to that credibility is its use as a source in [Sunday School manuals](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/the-pearl-of-great-price-student-manual/joseph-smith-history?lang=eng).

&nbsp;

The plot thickens, though!
Deseret News - 23 August 1865, page 4: [https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=2598412](https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=2598412)

>"_Happening lately, while on a preaching trip to Cache Valley, to pick up a book which was lying on a table in the house where we were stopping, we were surprised to find that it was the book bearing the title on the outside, of "Joseph Smith, the Prophet;" and on the title page, "Biographical Sketches of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and his progenitors for many generations, by Lucy Smith, mother of the Prophet; .._

>_Our surprise at finding a copy of this work may be accounted for by the fact of_ **_our having advertised some time ago that the book was incorrect, and that it should be gathered up and destroyed, so that no copies should be left_**; **_and, from this, we had supposed that not a single copy could be found in any of the houses of the Saints_**. ...

>_When the book was written mother Smith sent it to us to examine. In company with some others, who were acquainted with the circumstances alluded to in the book, we read the manuscript and we soon saw that it was incorrect. ..._

>**_It is transmitting lies to posterity._**_.. The_ **_curse of God_** _will rest upon everyone after he comes to the knowledge of what is here said who keeps these books for his children to learn and believe in lies._ **_We wish those who have these books to either hand them to their Bishops for them to be conveyed to the President's or Historian's Office, or send them themselves, that they may be disposed of._**_"_

Goodness. What kind of lies might be perpetuated in Lucy's account? I hope it isn't the observation that Joseph was imagining the Book of Mormon well before Moroni reveals the plates to him. That could affect the book's claim to divine origins.

&nbsp;

## How do we define “martyr”?
Joseph had a gun and fought back ([1](https://books.google.ca/books?id=EXjTCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false), [2](https://fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Joseph_Smith_fired_a_gun_at_Carthage_Jail), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Joseph_Smith#Incarceration_at_Carthage_Jail), [4](https://www.deseret.com/faith/2021/4/1/22358412/11-fascinating-images-of-latter-day-saint-artifacts/)). How does this fit with “[praise to the man](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/praise-to-the-man?lang=eng)”? Was his blood shed by assassins? Or was it a mob, sick of his bullshit?

How many other religious leaders get a lynching mob sent after them while they're Imprisoned? He fought back, emptying a six-shooter into a crowd. I can concede that this was in a panic since his life was in immediate danger; not saying he shouldn’t have, nor that I would have reacted differently. I’m saying he did, and I was raised to believe he did not.

&nbsp;

## As was foretold...
> ***33** He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that ==my name should be had for good and evil among all nations==, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.*

— [Joseph Smith - History 1:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)

Joseph Smith's name "shall be had for good and for evil among all nations"? What exactly does that mean? Hasn't Mark Zuckerberg's name also been had for good and evil among all nations? Mussolini? Czar Nicholas III? Michael Jackson? Sam Bankman-Fried? Anyone with a wide reach will have their name for good and evil. Having both fanatic supporters and vitriolic opponents doesn't make Joseph Smith special.

I could also say something pretty similar about myself. I bet someone will like what I wrote and have positive things to say. I also imagine someone will find it egregiously offensive and voice that opinion. (on the *internet* of all places 🫢) Observing this won't make me special, either. Go check YouTube's front page for whichever high-profile content creator is prevalent this month. If they anticipated both fame and infamy, would that make them a prophet?

## Misinformation
Lots of information can be found about Joseph Smith. The LDS church's correlated material really likes to focus on the positive, faith-promoting angle, and occasionally criticizes the naysayers for spreading misinformation.

I will concede that some of what I've read about Joseph is not compelling. I've encountered some claims that I, personally, subjectively, don't find to be useful. I'll list some here, and likely add more as I find them.

-  Joined the Methodist church in 1828
	- Every claim I've encountered cites back to this [UTLM document](http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/josephsmithmethodist.htm). The article does also back up its claims with sources, but by my subjective estimation, the sources don't seem compelling; 15 years after the fact, recalling someone said something about it. 🤷‍♂️ Big if true, but to me, I wouldn't put a lot of weight on it.
-  [Psalter Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek_Psalter_Incident)
	- The claim here is that Professor Caswall showed Smith some Greek psalms, and Smith concluded that it was reformed Egyptian text. This harms Smith's credibility as identifying ancient text languages. Caswall is quoted, “Whether he spoke as a prophet or as a mere man, he has committed himself, for he has said what is not true. If he spoke as a prophet, therefore, he is a false prophet. If he spoke as a mere man, he cannot be trusted, for he spoke positively and like an oracle respecting that which he knew nothing.”
	- Again, big if true, I suppose. I have yet to find compelling documentation that Henry Caswell was a respected professor, had linguistic expertise, or could be accurately called a Greek Psalter. Looking for primary sources for these claims have not been fruitful. Maybe Caswall met Smith, presented this challenge, and Smith misidentified the text. The quoted conclusion makes sense, but I'm not entirely sure this encounter is a real breakthrough.
