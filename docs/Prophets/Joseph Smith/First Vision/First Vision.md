# 🕶 First Vision
> *In the spring of 1820, God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith as he prayed in a grove of trees near his home in western New York. This event is known as the ==First Vision==.*

&mdash; *[First Vision](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/first-vision?id=p1&lang=eng#p1)*, Topics and Questions

&nbsp;

> *Our whole strength rests on the validity of that [first] vision. ==It either occurred or it did not occur==. If it did not, then this work is a fraud. If it did, then it is the most important and wonderful work under the heavens.*

— *[The Marvelous Foundation of our Faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2002/10/the-marvelous-foundation-of-our-faith?lang=eng)*, President Gordon B. Hinckley, General Conference October 2002

🤔

&nbsp;

Put simply, there are multiple accounts of Joseph Smith's First Vision. At face value, repeating a story to increase exposure and communicate to a broader audience makes sense. ==This would be a non-issue== if the story being told was consistent. I should expect that this story is one that does not allow any room for discrepancy. The timeline of these accounts is absolutely worth considering. Reportedly, it took place in 1820. The LDS church was formally founded in 1830. The earliest documented appearance of this story is 1832. The earliest record of the First Vision being actively propagated is in *1839*. This means that by the time *most* LDS church members will have heard about this critical, foundational event, it will have been *nineteen years* past.

Between 1820 and 1832 (a *twelve year gap*) there is not a single mention of Joseph Smith having witnessed any kind of divine intervention. Between the church's founding and the earliest record of the First Vision is a stint of two years, give or take some months&mdash;and that record is in Joseph's personal journal. Prior to 1839, scarce citations exist of the First Vision. Anyone joining the church in this *nine year* window of time will not have the context nor even a notion that this church was *[[Restoration|restored]]*, or is in contrast to apostasy. This is reflected in sermons given decades later, when early converts who become figureheads like George Q Cannon, Orson Pratt, even Brigham Young actively try to shut down this *crazy rumor* floating around that God appeared to Brother Joseph. Yes, [[First Vision Contemporaries#Early Church Leaders|I have receipts]] to back up that assertion.

&nbsp;

I'll demonstrate here why I believe this is a problem. If we heed the words of modern-day prophets, this either happened or it didn't, and there is no room for middle ground. If it didn't happen, "then this work is a fraud." I've got a link above to the General Conference talk where Gordon B. Hinckley says this. Go on and read the talk if I'm somehow taking that quote out of context.

&nbsp;

## Significance
If the First Vision didn't happen, then Joseph Smith did not restore Christ's church. If Joseph Smith did not restore Christ's church, what is this organization?

If God hadn't personally appeared to advise Joseph directly that all other churches were incorrect, then Joseph is just adding to the confusion by making one more flavor of Christianity. If we were to argue that Joseph became a prophet later than 1820, then *that* would be the selling point that missionaries tell their ~~investigators~~ "friends" about on the first lesson. In my experience as a missionary for the LDS church, I was required to recite the 1838 account from memory on demand. And *that's what I did*. Imagine my dismay when, after reciting this to however many dozens or hundreds of people, I find that this theophany wasn't as clear-cut and simple as I had been told.

&nbsp;

## Accounts
For whatever reason, there's an uncomfortably long span of time between God Himself appearing to mankind, and that event being recorded.

In some, but not all of Joseph Smith's records (minimum twelve years displaced) he mentions how no one believes his story. That is a relevant factor, for sure&mdash;assuming someone had believed him, they would likely have written it in their journal, or bantered in a newspaper column, saying something like "that Smith boy told me the darndest thing the other day!" or "this little fella told me that God appeared to him. Fancy that! We should listen to other things he has to say." I'll explain in [[First Vision Similar Experiences|more detail later]], but this absence of records might have had something to do with God appearing to *so many other people* in New England in the early 19th century. 

*Joseph's story wasn't unique*&mdash;a typical response wouldn't be "wow, God appeared to you in the woods with no other witnesses around? Fascinating, tell me more!" it would instead be "ugh, you too?" Assuming Joseph did tell people, that was such a common claim that his story wouldn't have been notorious to anyone. Not even Joseph's own family wrote down anything of the sort until after 1838. They did write about it, but only after Joseph canonically retrofitted it into the context of his church's founding. I might expect to see in his siblings' journals "my dork-ass brother says he saw God. Isn't that inspiring / preposterous / blasphemous / evidentiary / breathtaking  / absurd / exciting?" Instead I find... nothing.

&nbsp;

What we do have, though, are scans of Joseph Smith's own personal journal where [[Book of Abraham#Written by whom?|written by his own hand]] is his accounting of the First Vision. This is the record dated closest to the actual event, so one might think that it holds more gravitas than the others. Let's give it a look-see, shall we?

&nbsp;

### 1832
Summer of 1832 is the *first recorded mention* of the first vision. I cannot understate how this was written **two years after** the church was founded, and ***twelve years after*** the vision reportedly happened.

You can read it for yourself from an official publication on the LDS church's site: under its Library > Books and Lessons > Church History - Resources > First Vision > [Circa Summer 1832 History](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1832-account?lang=eng). <br>
It can also be found in the *Joseph Smith Papers Project* [here](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1). Actually, please do go look at the original scans, because it sure looks to me like the pages are held in with tape. Almost as if the pages had at one point been torn out from the book at one point...

&nbsp;

I'll share a bullet list of notorious features in this account:

- Joseph is fifteen years old ("in the 16th year of my age")
- Joseph was not asking which church to join
- Joseph already concluded that all other churches were false
- Joseph "cried unto the Lord for mercy\[;\]" Motivation for praying was existential
- No attack by Satan
- The Lord appeared, forgave Joseph's sins
- The Lord verified that other churches were false, and He doesn't like that very much

... and that's pretty much it.

&nbsp;

This is the earliest accounting of the First Vision and it's notably different from what later becomes canonized. We'll examine discrepancy later, but wouldn't you think that the account closest to the actual event would be most accurate?

Problems arise if we give this account (written by Joseph Smith himself, no scribe this time) any real consideration. If God didn't appear to advise Joseph that other churches were wrong, and simply forgave his sins, would any of us be talking about it 200 years later?

In fact, this is such a theological outlier, that we shouldn't be surprised to find that a certain church historian cut the pages out of Joseph's journal to make the remaining accounts internally consistent. [[First Vision Concealment|More on that later]].

&nbsp;

### 1835
Read it for yourself!
Library > Books and Lessons > Church History - Resources > First Vision > [Journal, 9–11 November 1835](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1835-account?lang=eng)
*Joseph Smith Papers Project*: [Journal, 1835–1836](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/25)

&nbsp;

Summary:<br>
- Joseph is "\[a\]bout 14 years old"
- Joseph resolves that "I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences"
- Joseph prays seeking information on who was right
- Unable to verbally pray in first attempts; no explanation why
- *Two* personages appear; the second forgives Joseph's sins
- Personage "testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God"
- Also lots of angels

&nbsp;

Now we've got *two* divine figures.

![[now-there-are-two.gif]]{: .center .size40}

&nbsp;

Tally of factors consistent between these two accounts:

- Joseph prayed
- A divine figure forgives Joseph's sins
<br>
&nbsp;

Tally of factors *inconsistent* between these two accounts:

- Age
- Motivation (existential vs. "I should pick the right one")
- Context of prayer (all churches are already wrong; now which one is right?)
- Number of divine figures appearing (one vs. two plus many angels)
- Response of the divine figure(s)
<br>
&nbsp;

I don't feel like we're off to a good start. We're only two accounts in, and the story has already changed enough that I'd begin to question A) if this happened, and B) if it matters. God (or maybe not God) appeared and forgave your sins. *Hot dog*, I require no further assurance of this man's divine appointment to be a prophet!

&nbsp;

### 1838
Library > Scriptures > Pearl of Great Price > Joseph Smith—History [1:4-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=5-20#4)
*Joseph Smith Papers Project*: [History, circa June 1839–circa 1841, Draft 2](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2?p=2)

&nbsp;

Here's the officially sanctioned version. It's much more verbose, and is the one I was drilled on in the mission field, the one found in Preach My Gospel, and canonized in scripture. You didn't ask for it, but I will emphasize again the ==eighteen year gap== between this account and the date it happened.

Summary:<br>
- Joseph was in his "fifteenth year;" "... early spring of 1820"
- Joseph's mind was greatly excited by religious debate
- Joseph isn't sure if truth is to be found. If so, where? Let's pray and find out
- Joseph was "seized upon by some power," "thick darkness gathered," felt "doomed to sudden destruction"
- Two personages appear; one introduces the other as "my beloved Son"
- Jesus (presumably) answered that Joseph "must join none of them"
- "[[Book of Mormon#Cannot be written|and many other things did he say unto me which I cannot write at this time]]."

&nbsp;

Something I find suspicious about this account is Joseph's response to the words spoken directly from the mouth of God Himself.... assuming this is God appearing.

God says "this is my beloved son, hear Him," and Joseph's reaction is, and I quote, "No sooner ... did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right... and which I should join."

Just feels out of place to me. God appears and says "listen up! Jesus is talking." and Joseph immediately cuts Him off, "hold on, hooolld up right there, I have questions first!"

🤔

&nbsp;

Tally of factors consistent across all three of these accounts:

- Joseph prayed

&nbsp;

I'll show a comparison of inconsistencies after the fourth account to avoid redundancy.

&nbsp;

### 1842
How does the story develop ***twenty-two years*** after the fact?

Library > Books and Lessons > Church History - Resources > First Vision > [“Church History,” 1 March 1842 (Wentworth Letter)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1842-account?lang=eng)
*Joseph Smith Papers Project*: [“Church History,” 1 March 1842](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/church-history-1-march-1842/1?p=1)

&nbsp;

Summary:<br>
- Joseph is "about fourteen years of age"
- Joseph sees "the importance of being prepared for a future state," and finds conflicting claims between churches
- Joseph prays to ask for clarification
- No resistance or difficulty in praying
- While "enwrapped in a heavenly vision," saw two identical personages
- "They told me that all religious denominations" were incorrect 
- "The fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me."

&nbsp;

### Comparison
Tally of factors consistent across all four of these accounts:

- Joseph prayed

&nbsp;

Comparison of factors *inconsistent* between all four accounts (and please remember that the church was founded in 1830):

&nbsp;

Man, get your story straight.

Imagine hearing someone tell you that "God appeared to me fifteen years ago! No, I didn't tell anyone at the time. I mean, maybe it wasn't *God*, but Jesus was there. Kind of, one figure testifies *of* Jesus, but neither really told me explicitly who they were. Though maybe there was only one figure who showed up. Don't remember for sure, but there was definitely at least one personage in a pillar of light! Anyway, they told me that you're wrong, but didn't exactly say what was right. No, nobody else was around to corroborate this."

The next week, you hear this same guy sadly lamenting "no one believes my story 🥺"

i fucken wonder why
