# 😤 Brigham Young
Before delving in, I'll point readers to the [[Prophets/index#👨‍💼 Prophets|landing page under Prophets]]. The idea of discounting what a prophet says as "speaking as a man" is preposterous to me. Defending Brigham Young by categorizing his words as "not divinely inspired" whenever his statements make the church look bad is a shit argument. Not every word he said was written down. The words that have survived today were likely recorded for a reason. Anyone in public office runs this risk, theological authority or not. Being "taken out of context" is only a good defense if the proper context can be provided, and that context somehow makes Brigham's advocacy of slavery more palatable.

Also worth mentioning notes on the [[Sources and Links#Journal of Discourses|Journal of Discourses]]. Many of Brigham's teachings that the modern church likes to distance itself from are found in those documents. Probably just a coincidence.

&nbsp;

## Teachings of the Presidents of the Church
One might then assert that Brigham's words were for the saints at his time, and we should focus on living prophets.

> *The prophet Brigham Young taught the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in a ==basic, practical way that gave inspiration and hope to the Saints== struggling to build a home in the wilderness. Though more than a century has now passed, ==his words are still fresh and appropriate for us today== as we continue the work of building the kingdom of God.*
>
> . . .
>
> *This book reflects the desire of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to ==deepen the doctrinal understanding of Church members== and to awaken within them a greater desire to know the things of God. It will inspire and motivate individuals, priesthood quorums, and Relief Society classes to inquire, read, search, and then go to their Father in Heaven for a witness of the truth of these teachings.*

Not sure if it's worth observing that, for all the emphasis the church likes to place on living prophets over dead ones, the above quote is from a series of instructional "books and lessons" on [Teachings of Presidents of the Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/books-and-lessons/teachings-of-presidents?lang=eng). The church itself is publishing these teachings; I can't say for certain how they're used in weekly church services today, but when I was an impressionable young fellow in the early 2000's, I remember seeing Sunday school instructors trying to bargain with the ward librarian to get *these exact books* to use as teaching materials for the 2nd hour of classes.

I imagine that they can't really back out of the pattern now. The church president who puts a stop to this would have to use the rationale "don't listen to them, listen to *me*." They'd need some really suave wordsmithing to make that sound less like a cult.

### Sources
> *. . . Each statement has been referenced, and the original spelling and punctuation have been preserved; ==however, the sources cited will not be readily available to most members==. These ==original sources are not necessary to have== in order to effectively study or teach from this book. Members need not purchase additional references and commentaries to study or teach these chapters. ==The text provided in this book, accompanied by the scriptures, is sufficient for instruction==. Members should prayerfully read and study President Young’s teachings in order to gain new insights into gospel principles and discover how those principles apply to their everyday lives. ==By faithfully and prayerfully studying these selections==, Latter-day Saints will have a greater understanding of gospel principles and will more fully appreciate ==the profound and inspired teachings of this great prophet==.*

— Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young, [Introduction](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-brigham-young/introduction?lang=eng&id=p4#p4)

"We'll cite some sources, but deadass *do not* look up the original documents. [It's 1997](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-brigham-young/title-page?lang=eng), after all- what, are you going to use some kind of 'computer' that connects to a network of other machines to find the citations? Good luck with that one 😏"

It'd be really awkward if the church's own curated list of Brigham's sermons came from the Journal of Discourses. That might lend credence to the series' legitimacy. Yep. That'd just... just be a really odd dilemma for them to find themselves in. Well anyway, right before the book's index is [Works Cited and Abbreviations Used](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-brigham-young/works-cited-and-abbreviations-used?lang=eng). It does list "JD" as an abbreviation used in place of *Journal of Discourses*. I downloaded the [pdf of the book](https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/f9/73/f9736b040ae611ecbf18eeeeac1e5d0bc1647165/teachings_of_presidents_brigham_young_1998_99.pdf), did a search for "JD", and only came up with the page of abbreviations. Phew; dodged a bullet there. It'd be awkward if the church used the JoD as a direct source!

Skimming the book, though, there are numerous citations of *DBY*. That's an abbreviation for *Discourses of Brigham Young*. Let's do some searching... [BYU's Scholar Archive](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wordcruncher/16/) has an entry for *Discourses of Brigham Young*. We can find the book online through [various means](https://archive.org/details/discoursesofbrig028407mbp/page/94/mode/2up). I'll skim some pages... I see at the end of many paragraphs a set of two numbers, like *8:153-4*. I have my suspicions, but let me check for a deliberate explanation for this...

At the bottom of chapter 1, page 1: 
> *The numbers at the end of each excerpt refer to the volume and page of the Journal of Discourses. Where the excerpt occurs thus, 13:233, it means Journal of Discourses, volume 13, page 233.*

Son of a bitch. They're not citing the Journal of Discourses directly, they're citing a book that is a collection of quotes from the Journal of Discourses. Let's make absolutely sure this is what's happening. I'll look for a short passage in the interest of search queries.

Hoo boy. Are there any other spicy things in this book, used as the primary source for quotes from Brigham Young, for use in their officially sanctioned Sunday School manual?

Teachings on [[Blood Atonement]] right there in the exact same source material that the church's own published book uses as a source. I will defecate myself right here, right now, if the comment section suggests this *Discourses of Brigham Young* is "anti-Mormon" literature. God*dammit*.

I can't explain the discrepancy between the page numbers in the *Teachings of the Presidents* manual and the *DBY* source. Maybe they're different editions. But I don't imagine that the 1997 First Presidency expected that lay folk would actually be able to dig up the source used. I don't know that I would have, if they hadn't outright told me to not bother looking up the source.

## "My words are important!"
That's not a direct quote. 

This is a direct quote, though:

> *Well, brethren and sisters, try and be Saints. I will try; I have tried many years to live according to the law which the Lord reveals unto me. I know just as well what to teach this people and just what to say to them and what to do in order to bring them into the celestial kingdom, as I know the road to my office. It is just as plain and easy. The Lord is in our midst. He teaches the people continually. ==I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call Scripture. Let me have the privilege of correcting a sermon, and it is as good Scripture as they deserve==.*

— [Latter-Day Saint Families, etc.](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t1fbdd:j13); Brigham Young, [Journal of Discourses 13](https://scriptures.byu.edu/jod/pdf/JoD13/JoD13.pdf):95b.

&nbsp;

> *Brigham Young has said “when he sends forth his discourses to the world ==they may call them Scripture==.” I say now, when they are copied and approved by me ==they are as good Scripture as is couched in this Bible==, and if you want to read revelation read the sayings of him who knows the mind of God, without any special command to one man to go here, and to another to go yonder, or to do this or that, or to go and settle here or there. In the early days of the Church, if a man was going to sell a farm he must have a revelation—Joseph must receive and give a revelation. ==Many men would not do one thing until God had given them a revelation through the prophet==.*

> *If there is an Elder here, or any member of this Church, called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who can bring up the first idea, the first sentence that I have delivered to the people as counsel that is wrong, I really wish they would do it; but they cannot do it, for the simple reason that ==I have never given counsel that is wrong==;*

## Race
> *I will remark with regard to slavery, inasmuch as we believe in the Bible, inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of God, in the Priesthood and order and decrees of God, ==we must believe in slaver==y. This colored race have been subjected to severe curses, which they have in their families and their classes and in their various capacities ==brought upon themselves==. And until the curse is removed by Him who placed it upon them, they must suffer under its consequences; I am not authorized to remove it. ==I am a firm believer in slavery==.*
>
> *. . . But they cannot share in the Priesthood; they cannot bear rule; they cannot bear rule in any place until the curse is removed from them; they are a ‘servant of servants.’*
>
> *. . . I know it is right, and there should be a law made to have the slaves serve their masters, because they are not capable of ruling themselves.*
>
> *When the Lord God cursed old Cain, He said, ‘Until the last drop of Abel’s blood receives the Priesthood, and enjoys the blessings of the same, Cain shall bear the curse;’ then Cain is calculated to have his share next and not until then; consequently, I am firm in the belief that they ought to dwell in servitude.*

Boy, this guy sure sounds like he was called of God to speak in His behalf.

&nbsp;

#### Get the priesthood in some future day
> *Now I tell you what I know; when the mark was put upon Cain, Abels children was in all probability young; the Lord told Cain that he should not receive the blessings of the preisthood nor his seed, until the last of the posterity of Able had received the preisthood, until the redemtion of the earth.*

## Can speak cow 🐄
> *The 160-mile leg across Illinois was a grueling forty-eight hours as their coach stopped only for food, fresh teams, and to pry themselves and other wagons from the mud. At one point, a heavily loaded wagon belonging to Norwegian immigrants was bogged in the mire, and the Norwegians were whipping and bawling at their oxen. ==According to one account, Young looked over the situation, stepped from the coach, and coaxed the animals in a language unknown to either the Norwegians or the Americans==. Then a light touch of the whip got the calmed animals to lift the wagon, and the Norwegians went ahead with their journey—to “the surprise and amusement of the passengers” in the coach.*

## Popularity
> *Many wish for the time when President Brigham Young and his brethren will be relieved from attending to temporal matters, and attend to spiritual matters altogether. You will have to wait for this until we get into the spiritual world and have to deal with spirits.*

"I'm feeling dissatisfied with a theocratic dictator who is very open about talking of killing his followers." "Tough shit, wait til he dies before things will get any better."
