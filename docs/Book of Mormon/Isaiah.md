# Isaiah
## Isaiah chapters

A lot of what Joseph Smith wrote into the BoM were nearly word-for-word chapters from KJV Isaiah.

Isaiah chapters were post-Babylonian diaspora, and Laban wouldn’t have those.

1 Nephi starts around 600BC, right? If those chapters of Isaiah were written in 515BC and later, we’ve got problems.

Laban would not have the Torah or Pentateuch. Written records of that time period didn’t exist.

## Deutero-Isaiah

See above; 2 Nephi quotes passages from Isaiah that would not have been written til ~95 years after Lehi left Jerusalem.

Completely ignores conflict of logic in Isaiah, focusing on prescient insights for future generations.
