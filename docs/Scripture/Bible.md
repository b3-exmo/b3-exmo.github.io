> *We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.*

— _[8th Article of Faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)_

What translation issues are there? Do we have any authoritative answer to specific passages that are changed/removed/incorrectly translated? Did [[#Joseph Smith Translation|JST]] address all of them, and the LDS Standard Works OT & NT are now “translated correctly”? I should think that with all the materials and study manuals that the church has provided, we'd have ample time to separate what's accurate from those "philosophies of men" that got snuck in. I should also think that the church led by God's chosen prophets wouldn't perpetuate and republish mistranslated directives from God.

Without any clarification, it sounds like this gives the church permission to repudiate specific parts, as if “that’s one of the mistranslated parts” but what supports our existing doctrine is translated fine.

The passage specifying that [women aren't allowed to speak](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) in meetings? Nah, that's a mis-translation. To our modern sensibilities, it's both unambiguous and discriminatory. That whole symbolic [Stick of Judah](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/37?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) thing, though, they nailed that one. Inspired writing, it is! Just the right level of vague.

&nbsp;

## King James Version
Honest question- on what grounds is KJV the “most accurate” translation? Have we (in the LDS faith) examined the other translations? If so, when was that examination? What were the conclusions? How are we quantifying accuracy? KJV is certainly what Joseph Smith grew up with. Is that all the grounds we need?

> *Today, English-speaking Church members use the Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Version of the Bible. ==Based on the doctrinal clarity of latter-day revelation== given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, ==the Church has held to the King James Version as being doctrinally more accurate== than recent versions.*

— _[400 Years of the King James Bible](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2011/08/400-years-of-the-king-james-bible?lang=eng&id=aside4_p2#aside4_p2)_, Ensign, August 2011

To date, I haven't found [record](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/search?query=king+james) of that. The claim in the above quote doesn't have a citation to back it up.

&nbsp;

> *It is not by chance or coincidence that we have the Bible today. Righteous individuals were prompted by the Spirit to record both the sacred things they saw and the inspired words they heard and spoke. Other devoted people were prompted to protect and preserve these records. Men like John Wycliffe, the courageous William Tyndale, and Johannes Gutenberg were prompted against much opposition to translate the Bible into language people could understand and to publish it in books people could read. I believe even the scholars of King James had spiritual promptings in their translation work.*

Its powerful, majestic style has made it a literary classic, with many of its phrases and expressions embedded in our language. ==Earlier generations were ‘brought up’ with this translation== and learnt many of its verses by heart.*

### Imperfect translation
> *“Though it is the most important book in the religious life and culture of the English-speaking world, the King James Bible or Authorized Version of 1611 ==has never been perfectly printed==,” wrote David Norton, a professor at Victoria University who recently published the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible. “What we now read as the King James Bible contains ==numerous deliberate and some accidental changes to the text==, and these can be revised to make it more faithful to the King James translators’ own decisions as to how it should read.”*

— *[Understanding the Process of Publishing the Book of Mormon](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/understanding-the-process-of-publishing-the-book-of-mormon#)*, Church Newsroom, January 2008

A professor at Victoria University shouldn't be thought of as an LDS church authority, but for the church to publish this quote in a newsroom report sure does lend it credence.

This will become very relevant in the next section.

### Could we get a re-translation?
#### Modern attempt(s)
> *Few scholars have the expertise, let alone the confidence, to embark on a new translation of the New Testament for Latter-day Saints. Fortunately, Thomas Wayment has enough of both. ... His [new translation](https://amzn.to/2WzQEgV) was published by Deseret Book and the BYU Religious Studies Center—just in time for the church’s 2019 focus on the New Testament. This conversation focuses on his new translation and new perspectives he gained during the process, including some surprises.*

&nbsp;

> *This new translation from the best available Greek manuscripts renders the New Testament text into modern English and is sensitive to Latter-day Saint beliefs and practices. This translation is readable and accessible for a wide range of readers.*

&nbsp;

Thomas Wayment has a PhD in New Testament studies (see his [bio page](https://rsc.byu.edu/author/wayment-thomas) in BYU's *Religious Studies Center*), which means he knows a lot more about scripture than I do. Seeing how he was employed by BYU, the LDS church's private university, I assume he has good intentions and good qualifications to try and do this. So why, then, did I find out about this modern translation five years after it was published? Did *you* know about the BYU professor who published a new translation of the New Testament?

I can observe two things: his bio page, linked above, does state he publications director of BYU's Religious Studies Center until 2018. His book was published in early 2019. He is now a professor of Classical Studies. At the time of writing, his Humanities [bio page](https://hum.byu.edu/directory/thomas-wayment) verifies that title.

I can only offer conjecture, but I suspect his change from departments had to do with his insubordination to [[#Who can translate?|do what a prophet, seer, revelator, and translator]] does. Terminating employment would be a bad look. Let's send him to another department, even though he demonstrated that New Testament seems to be his wheelhouse (you know, having a PhD and all that.)

The only other name that comes to mind for biblical scholars is one [Dan McClellan](https://www.maklelan.org/about), who has a [really neat podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwC6CRSpee0sVJ6Wl3G7BmklCFm-Lq_22) on the Bible, and even has a [BYU article](https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-20-no-2-2019/far-it-translated-correctly-bible-translation-church) commenting on Bible translations, including a section on Wayment's publication. At the time of writing this note, I haven't read it yet, but I've got it bookmarked! 🙃

## Who can translate?
> *Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man ==that can translate the records==; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and ==it is a gift from God==. And the things are called interpreters . . . [a]nd whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called ==seer==.*

— _[Mosiah 8:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)_

&nbsp;

> *Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation . . . the gift of the Holy Ghost, and ==the gift of translation==;*

— _[Alma 9:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p21#p21)_

&nbsp;

> *And again, ==the duty of the President of the office of the High Priesthood== is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses—*
>
> *Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, ==a translator==, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.*

> *I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding elder over all my church, ==to be a translator==, a revelator, a seer, and prophet.*

— _[D&C 124:125](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p125#p125)_

&nbsp;

> *Behold, there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, ==a translator==, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ[.]*

— _[D&C:21:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)_

Bonus link: Original manuscript of that passage in JS Papers Project. Doesn't really lend more credence, but [here it is](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/revelation-6-april-1830-dc-21/1).

&nbsp;

I think its safe to assume that, if Joseph Smith was a prophet, that he is also a "translator." It'd be a pretty bad look if he were to be shown to mistranslate something, but we'll get to that later.
If JS was a prophet, seer, revelator, and translator, and that same priesthood authority got passed down to Young, Taylor, Woodruff, and so on down to Monson & Nelson, I should think that they could also act as a translator.
So... If, according to the article of faith, the bible can be used only "as far as it is translated correctly", I am left to wonder if Joseph Smith's own translation of the bible addressed those issues?

If so, why would the modern LDS faith not use the JST exclusively?
If not, why do we cite that article of faith? Moreover, could we ask Nelson, or any other modern LDS church leader to clarify or rectify translation issues?

&nbsp;

## Joseph Smith Translation
The audacity?

> *Because the Lord revealed to Joseph certain truths that the original authors had once recorded, the Joseph Smith Translation is unlike any other Bible translation in the world. In this sense, the word translation is used in a broader and different way than usual, for ==Joseph’s translation was more revelation than literal translation from one language into another==.*

— _[Introduction page to the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/introduction?lang=eng)_

Oh. It’s not… It’s not even a translation? It’s a revelation accompaniment? Why are we calling it translation? It says right there it isn’t translation.

&nbsp;

## Plain and Precious things
> *And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the ==plain and precious things which have been taken away== from them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.*

— _[1 Ne 13:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=40#p40)_

&nbsp;

This BoM passage is cited as evidence that the Bible is incomplete, and BoM fills in the gaps.

Legitimate question: what gaps? The Book of Mormon doesn't have hardly any Mormon [[Scripture/Book of Mormon/index#Fullness of the Gospel|doctrines or practices]] in it. If the intent of the BoM is to prove Smith's legitimacy, and his legitimacy proves modern church leadership, then no, the BoM is not filling in gaps- modern prophets are.

&nbsp;

> *“Surely ==the most plain and precious of all truths lost from the Bible==, particularly the Old Testament, are the clear and unequivocal declarations of the mission of Jesus Christ, his foreordained role as Messiah and Savior of the world, and the covenantal elements of his gospel, which have been taught from Adam down through each succeeding dispensation. ==Thus the Book of Mormon’s highest purpose== is to restore to the universal family of God that crucial knowledge of Christ’s role in the salvation of every man, woman, and child who now lives, has ever lived, or will yet live upon the earth.”*

— _[Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2006/10/plain-and-precious-truths-restored)_, Jeffrey R Holland, Ensign 1997, 6–7.

Find me a practicing Christian who didn’t already know that from reading the Bible alone.
