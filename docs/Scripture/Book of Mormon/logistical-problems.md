## Anachronisms
> *. . . I spoke with a good friend, not a member of the Church. He said he had ==a list of 50 anachronisms== in the Book of Mormon that demonstrated the book was a nineteenth-century invention. An anachronism refers to something that is chronologically out of place, a bit like saying Julius Caesar drove his SUV into Rome. Well, I told my friend that ==he was too late, for I had received a witness of the truth== of the Book of Mormon. But I said to him, “Give me your list, and I will keep it.” I did keep that list, and over the years, as more research was done by various academics, one item after another dropped off the list.*
>
> *A few years ago when I was speaking to a group at Cornell University, I mentioned my list and noted that, after these many years, only one item remained. After my presentation a distinguished professor said to me, “You can remove your last item, for ==our studies indicate that it is not an anachronism==.”*

— *[The Quest for Spiritual Knowledge](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2007/06/the-quest-for-spiritual-knowledge?lang=eng&id=p6-p7#p6)*, Elder Robert S. Wood of the Seventy, Ensign June 2007

And that good friend's name? Albert Einstein. Then everyone stood up and clapped. *I'll take "things that never happened" for 500, Alex!*

We can take cheap shots at how preposterous this story is, but the point I want to focus on is this: A member of the seventy published in the church's official magazine that 50 anachronisms in the Book of Mormon have been debunked and disproven by a nameless "distinguished professor" at Cornell. That's a bold claim. It is measurable and demonstrable.

*Show us the list, then!* If this story happened, wouldn't the church proudly present the counter-arguments that disprove the claims of those critics? The last paragraph of that excerpt suggests to me that Elder Wood addressed 49 out of 50, and the last one was studied by this "distinguished professor" enough for him to dismiss it. Elder Wood, you are making provable claims. *Prove them.*

We reportedly have concrete information that proves critics wrong, thereby demonstrating that the Book of Mormon is of divine origin. This would be enough to draw public attention worldwide! What are the anachronisms, and what are the counterpoints that convince nameless faces at Cornell that this scripture is not a "19th century invention"?

Nothing? Was it [[Too Sacred to Share]]? We just gotta work it out through faith? *Why did you tell us this story, then?*

### Specifics
In case you were raised in the same technological environment I was, you may have a strong aversion to using Wikipedia as a source for anything. You can read elsewhere about its vetting process and quality control measures, but fortunately for me, its arguments citing primary sources is good enough for me. And since this compendium of notes is hardly material for making academic claims or assertions, I won't feel bad about pointing readers to Wikipedia for a summary of anachronisms with links to primary sources to back up those observations. In the future, I may interject with some comments of my own. For now, I'll be satisfied with this bullet list:

I, being a dumbass with a computer, can't really speak from experience concerning archaeology or how those educated folks arrive at their conclusions. Much like how a lay person doesn't worry themselves too much about [OSI model of network layers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-protocols/), [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) lookups, [HTTP handshakes & sessions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Session), [web application dependency management](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/best-practices-dependency-management) , or [browser rendering](https://frontendly.io/blog/browser-rendering); most folks know that when they tap the blue "F" icon on their smartphone, Facebook shows up. It may as well be magic. I could dig a hole in New Mexico, find a pottery shard, and think "huh, how about that." Someone with the right education could extrapolate a lot more than I could from that hypothetical encounter.

What I do know, though, is if I find a video describing how the real reason behind the Europe's bubonic plague was microchips made in South Korea, I will be very skeptical of that claim. So it is with the Book of Mormon anachronisms. If I read that an Israeli family from 600 BC mastered [[Scripture/Book of Mormon/Technology#Steel|metallurgy]] and [[Seafaring|seafaring]] in an isolated breakthrough of technology, leaving no trace and never reproducing those creations, I will be comparably skeptical.

[[logical-fallacies#Sagan Standard|Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence]], and I don't believe that "pray about it" is going to qualify as evidence.

&nbsp;

## Apostasy
How there could be an apostasy (no priesthood on the earth) if the 3 Nephites and John were still alive? Presumably they’re still around; what have they been doing for 1800 years? Those four were priesthood holders, right?

I suppose they didn't have the "office" of priesthood to qualify? 🤷 I guess Jesus dropped the ball on that one whoops lmao

&nbsp;

## Jaredites
### Timeline
>_The Book of Mormon Jaredite King List gives only 7 exact dates (lifespans and reigns) for the Jaredite Chronology. The only real markers we have to build a working chronology from are firstly, the date of the “dearth” or famine and megafauna extinction given in the narrative of Heth [Ether 9:30–34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p30-p34#p30). It’s important to note that it’s well established that Mastodons and other megafauna went extinct in most of continental North America at about 11 - 8,000 BC and the paleoindians role in killing them off and eating them amidst a major climate event (as explained in [Ether 9:30–34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p30-p34#p30)) is well documented in the archaeological record, so we must consider the possibility that if radiocarbon dates are not off (which they certainly may be for that period), then there is likely a large unknown break of thousands of years between the Jared to Heth, and the rest of the timeline._

### Seeing God
The brother of Jared is described as having like the most faith ever, and so he was able to [see God’s finger](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p6-p8#p6)… but Joseph Smith literally just prayed once and he got to see both Heavenly Father and Jesus. Their *full bodies*. Should we believe this means Joseph was super, uber, ultra-special faithful prior to the [[First Vision|first vision(s)]]?

&nbsp;

### How many people died?
>*He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly [two millions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng#note2a) of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.*

— *[Ether 15:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)*

Perhaps not all two million mighty men were married. Perhaps not all men were of age to fight a hand-to-hand war. Assuming we have `2,000,000` mighty men, most but not all would be married. `2,000,000 * (0.75) = 1,500,000` range wives of the 2mill soldiers. Next, add an average of `2.5` kids. We're looking at `6,000,000` casualties just of the families of the "mighty men" capable of fighting, not counting those too elderly to fight, or the workforce & governance back home to keep the economy from crashing completely. I don't know what life expectancy to anticipate for the days of Jaredites, so maybe I could extrapolate another `1 million` for those not in the fight? Too old? Too young? Children were already counted, so… maybe `7,500,000` people and no signs at all of their existence.

Let’s compare that to battle deaths on the _western front_ in the First World War. Over *4 years*, about [4 million men died on the western front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)#Aftermath). That’s *4 years* of intense artillery fire, machine guns, accurate rifles, poison gas, etc. This passage in Ether doesn't explicitly outline a time frame for the two million deaths. Maybe it was over eight years? I have no way of knowing.

Actually, you know what— six to seven million is a number that has a pretty direct comparison to the [number of Jewish people killed during the holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe). To be clear, the only comparison I'm making here is the number of deaths, ==no further implications other than scale==. Imagine numerous deaths on the scale of the 1940's holocaust, possibly greater, A) happening around 580 BCE, and B) just... poofing away. No mass graves to be found.

The idea that a bronze age civilizations would be capable of inflicting death on that scale— especially without leaving a trace— is patently absurd. That is such a high number to leave zero evidence whatsoever. The fact that the _entire civilization_ conveniently annihilated itself before the Nephites arrived is even more ridiculous.

&nbsp;

### How did they die?
As mentioned a moment ago, World War 1 was able to mete out such a grand scale of death so quickly given the available technology. I feel pretty confident that Jaredites did not have fully automatic machine guns, nor bomber planes. I imagine that the technology available to them in [580 b.c.](https://courses.byui.edu/BOM%20Timeline/html/timeline.html) would probably be clubs or pointy sticks, but [Mosiah 8:8-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?id=p8-p11&lang=eng#p8) demonstrates that Jaredites had enough knowledge of metallurgy to create armor of brass & copper, and swords out of what I assume is iron, given the rust. I can assume they have archery technology, given that archaeologists can find [arrowheads from 70,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_archery#Paleolithic_and_Epipaleolithic) (but no traces of ancient American holocaust-scale mass deaths.) We're reading about battles that result in two million soldiers dying from melee weapons, and maybe ranged archers.

Have you ever been to a football stadium? A concert? An international airport? Some kind of convention? Have you stood in a group of humans counting five hundred or more? Imagine being one of *two million* people, ready to engage in hand-to-hand combat. It's unusual for modern people to be in a group greater than ten thousand, as were [the size of Moroni's battalions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=p11-p16#p11). Now imagine walking to the parking lot from the stadium after the ball game ends. It would take you *hours* to walk the distance of a quarter-mile.

Do you see a logistical problem here? If your battalion is greater than, say, three hundred people, the fight is going to be akin to waiting in line for there to be a large enough gap for you to even swing your weapon. After standing in the crowd for four hours dodging enemy arrows raining down on you, you can approach the frontline, and climb over the growing pile of maimed bodies at the single line of conflict. Backing out of this hypothetical, now envision these 7 million bodies just vanishing without a trace.

Sounds to me like it *might just be* made up.

&nbsp;

### Wooden Submarines
Jaredites in wooden submarines. Jaredites with steel. Did [[Scripture/Book of Mormon/Technology|steel]] technology exist in 8000 BCE?

Giving this any amount of critical evaluation makes it sound more ridiculous than inspiring or faith-promoting. No propulsion, no steering, constant flipping, no food stores, no potable water, no waste disposal, and no solid way to tell time or know how long it took. I'm not sure they knew how to measure the number of days- did they write it down, or just talk out a consensus once they made landfall? If it was written, what was it recorded on? Etched on the inside wall between the smears of cow poop?

BoM describes Jaredites as having been “[led by God from the Tower of Babel to the Americas](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/jaredites).” I’m open to correction, but my google-sleuthing led me to the Tower of Babel being in [Iraq, near Baghdad](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YTsXjXz2s3otx2Ri9). I hope I'm not being bamboozled by some kind of tourist attraction.

Personally, I've never hiked more than ~8 miles in a day, and I've had adequate hydration, modern footwear, etc. I don’t know how feasible it is to travel from [Baghdad, Iraq to Beirut, Lebanon](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Beirut,+Lebanon/Baghdad,+Baghdad+Governorate,+Iraq) (~580 miles of desert), or [to Tel Aviv, Israel](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Tel+Aviv,+Israel/Baghdad,+Baghdad+Governorate,+Iraq) (~650 miles of desert), but that sounds non-trivial to me.

Then comes the Atlantic. Closest point by my eyeball estimation is Cape Cod in Mass. If they went in a straight line, it would be a minimum of `2700 + 3433 = 6133` miles.

[Ether 6:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) records the duration of time as being 344 days. 6133 miles is a low estimate, assuming straight lines. `6133 / 344 = ~17.8285`. Assuming they had propulsion, navigation and steering, I might call sailing 18 miles per day “not unreasonable.” However. It’s nearly a year of constant flipping around with only glowing stones as light. What did their animals eat for a year? 

I've heard the critical claim that the deseret beehives were in the barges as well- by my understanding, the bees were explicitly mentioned on the coast as the barges were being built, and never mentioned after. Were the hives brought along? Maybe. I hope not, I wouldn't want to be in a submarine that is constantly flipping with stinging insects inside. That's one point that [[Sources and Links|FAIR]] and I can [agree on](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:Did_the_Jaredites_bring_swarms_of_bees_across_the_ocean_in_their_barges).

Nephi & friends were able to invoke divine intervention so they wouldn’t have to cook their meat. That necessitates they still had to acquire the meat, though. I suppose the Jaredites got some fish when the barge flipped? How did they handle waste? A month in, every square inch of the inside would be covered in poop. An hour in and they've got some stressed livestock, probably trying to break out. As soon as they see sunlight through the hole in the top, that bull isn't going to patiently wait for the humans to allow it to exit, it's going to make every effort possible to escape, trampling anything in its way, not caring if there's land outside or not.

## Animals
What does the Church's website say about animals in the Book of Mormon? [Not much](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2008/08/for-little-friends/book-of-mormon-animals?lang=eng).

| Animals indigenous to the Americas                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Animals *not* indigenous to Americas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

&nbsp;

Take a guess which lists’ animals appear in the Book of Mormon, of ancient Americas?


### Goats
> *25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and ==the goat and the wild goat==, and all manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And we did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper.*

&mdash; [1 Nephi 18:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?id=p25&lang=eng#p25)

&nbsp;

To differentiate between goats and wild goats carries some implications. 

What makes the wild ones different? Are the non-wild ones *domesticated*? By whom? Are domesticated goats standing around, waiting for humanity to drop by?

Nephi is very specific about these creatures, identifying and distinguishing between these two varieties. That isn't problematic&mdash; it's noteworthy when compared to another of the animals listed: *the horse*.

&nbsp;

### Tapir
Horses indigenous to America had been made extinct by the ice age, and were absent from America before Christopher Columbus. 

How, then, do we handle Nephi's account that [there are horses standing around in plain sight](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p25#p25), alive and well, as soon as they land in America? Well, it *just so happens* that when we run into an anachronism when it comes to identifying animals, Nephi didn't actually mean *horse* when he said *horse*. Why would you think that? We never claimed it was *actually* a horse. Yes, this is the same verse where Nephi is very specific to differentiate goats versus wild goats, but if horses weren't around in 590 BCE, then the word horse doesn't mean horse.

[Or were they tapirs](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Book_of_Mormon/Anachronisms/Animals/Horses/Loanshifting:_deer_and_tapirs)?
