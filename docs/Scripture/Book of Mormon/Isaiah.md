# ðŸ¤· Isaiah
Note: This page doesn't have enough content; it'll likely change next time you drop by. Check again later!

## Isaiah chapters
A lot of what Joseph Smith wrote into the BoM were nearly word-for-word chapters from KJV Isaiah.

Isaiah chapters were post-Babylonian diaspora, and Laban wouldnâ€™t have those.

1 Nephi starts around 600BC, right? If those chapters of Isaiah were written in 515BC and later, weâ€™ve got problems.

Laban would not have the Torah or Pentateuch. Written records of that time period didnâ€™t exist.

## Deutero-Isaiah

See above; 2 Nephi quotes passages from Isaiah that would not have been written til ~95 years after Lehi left Jerusalem.

Completely ignores conflict of logic in Isaiah, focusing on prescient insights for future generations.
