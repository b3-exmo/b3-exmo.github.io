# üò¥ Lehi's Dream
I'll assume that you're already familiar with the chapters in First Nephi in the Book of Mormon. Nephi's father Lehi has a dream, featuring lots of symbolism. The dream itself is first described in [1 Ne 8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng), and then later in [Chapter 11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng), where Nephi sees the dream too, but this time with an angelic accompaniment to explain the symbolism.

I find this notorious because of Joseph Smith's father describing a dream he had back in 1811.

## Joseph Sr's Dream
I'll add some line breaks at my own discretion for the sake of readability. The original text is unbroken. It's a bit lengthy!

??? "Joseph Smith Senior's Dream"
	> *In 1811, we moved from Royalton, Vermont, to the town of Lebanon, New Hampshire. Soon after arriving here, my husband received another very singular vision, which I will relate:‚Äî*
	> 
	> > *"I thought," said he, "I was traveling in an open, desolate field, which appeared to be very barren. As I was thus traveling, the thought suddenly came into my mind that I had better stop and reflect upon what I was doing, before I went any further. So I asked myself, 'What motive can I have in traveling here, and what place can this be?' My guide, who was by my side, as before, said, 'This is the desolate world; but travel on.'*
	> > 
	> > *The road was so broad and barren, that I wondered why I should travel in it; for, said I to myself, 'Broad is the road, and wide is the gate that leads to death, and many there be that walk therein; but narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that leads to everlasting life, and few there be that go in thereat.' Traveling a short distance further, I came to a narrow path.*
	> > 
	> >*This path I entered, and, when I had traveled a little way in it, I beheld a beautiful stream of water, which ran from the east to the west. Of this stream, I could see neither the source nor yet the mouth; but as far as my eyes could extend I could see a rope, running along the bank of it, about as high as a man could reach, and beyond me, was a low, but very pleasant valley, in which stood a tree, such as I had never seen before. It was exceedingly handsome, insomuch that I looked upon it with wonder and admiration. Its beautiful branches spread themselves somewhat like an umbrella, and it bore a kind of fruit, in shape much like a chestnut bur, and as white as snow, or, if possible, whiter.* 
	> >
	> >*I gazed upon the same with considerable interest, and as I was doing so, the burs or shells commenced opening and shedding their particles, or the fruit which they contained, which was of dazzling whiteness. I drew near, and began to eat of it, and I found it delicious beyond description. As I was eating, I said in my heart, 'I cannot eat this alone, I must bring my wife and children, that they may partake with me.' Accordingly, I went and brought my family, which consisted of a wife and seven children, and we all commenced eating, and praising God for this blessing. We were exceedingly happy, insomuch that our joy could not easily be expressed.*
	> >
	> >*While thus engaged, I beheld a spacious building standing opposite the valley which we were in, and it appeared to reach to the very heavens. It was full of doors and windows, and they were all filled with people, who were very finely dressed. When these people observed us in the low valley, under the tree, they pointed the finger of scorn at us, and treated us with all manner of disrespect and contempt. But their contumely we utterly disregarded. I presently turned to my guide, and inquired of him the meaning of the fruit that was so delicious. He told me it was the pure love of God, shed abroad in the hearts of all those who love him, and keep his commandments.*
	> >
	> >*He then commanded me to go and bring the rest of my children. I told him that we were all there. 'No,' he replied, 'look yonder, you have two more, and you must bring them also.' Upon raising my eyes, I saw two small children, standing some distance off. I immediately went to them, and brought them to the tree; upon which they commenced eating with the rest, and we all rejoiced together. The more we ate, the more we seemed to desire, until we even got down upon our knees, and scooped it up, eating it by double handfulls.*
	> >
	> >*After feasting in this manner a short time, I asked my guide what was the meaning of the spacious building which I saw. He replied, 'It is Babylon, it is Babylon, and it must fall. The people in the doors and windows are the inhabitants thereof, who scorn and despise the Saints of God, because of their humility.' I soon awoke, clapping my hands together for joy."*

There exists a trope for fabricated stories to end with "and then everyone stood up and clapped," but, uh... Maybe that became a clich√© some time after 1811.

### Dissimilarities
I mean... I guess we could also try to find elements exclusive to one or the other?

- Nephi
	- Multitudes of people at the iron rod
- JS Sr
	- Guided by a rope, not iron

Beyond that... um... 16th century English vernacular?

## Apologetics
### FAIR
FAIR does what they do best, and offered some "potential explanations for the similarities:"

> 1. *Joseph Smith plagiarized Joseph Sr.'s dream when he wrote the Book of Mormon. This is the stance adopted by the critics.*
> 2. *Joseph Sr. had a dream that was similar to the dream experienced by Lehi, and this was a sign to the Prophet's family that he was translating a real record that came from God. This is certainly possible, though it is impossible to prove or disprove by historical techniques, and so will not be elaborated on. It remains, however, a viable option.*
> 3. *Lucy Mack Smith's account of the dream (which she recorded many years after the fact, when the Book of Mormon account was well-known and published) may have influenced how she remembered and/or recorded her account of Joseph Sr's dream.*

Maybe other possibilities are feasible. I haven't come up with any.

I guess I fit in the "critic" category, then, because I think the other two explanations are silly. If Joseph Smith Jr. translates a record of Lehi having a dream around 600 BC, hearing Joseph Sr. expressing a *suspiciously similar* dream does not affirm to me that either of them are prophetic. Joseph Smith Sr. was not a prophet. Why would God do that? How does that prove anything? Why would *that* be a sign of the Book of Mormon's legitimacy? Isn't that the Holy Spirit's job?

&nbsp;

> *\[It\] is impossible to prove or disprove by historical techniques, and so will not be elaborated on. It remains, however, a viable option.*

lol. lmao.

It won't demonstrate anything, nor can the claim itself be proven nor disproven. Still viable, though.

I am so glad that I don't have to do these mental gymnastics. The [[Book of Mormon#Probability / Occam‚Äôs Razor|simpler explanation]] is "a guy obscuring his sources for a book his livelihood depended on." 

&nbsp;

Don't forget the last of the listed possible explanations: Lucy Mack's accounting of Joseph Sr's dream was influenced by Joseph Smith Jr's translation of an ancient record etched onto metal plates in Reformed Egyptian‚Ñ¢Ô∏è dating to 600 BCE, because a prophet's son recording his father's dream *had to be preserved* to show that Joseph Jr's dad's dream was the same as Nephi's dad's dream, and it's all to prove that Joseph Jr is a real prophet.

Go on and scroll back up to the list of explanations. "This is the stance adopted by the critics." I wonder why? Must be that they wanted to justify their desire to sin.

### Saints Unscripted
> *Technically, ==it wasn‚Äôt even Lucy who physically wrote the book== ‚Äî it was her scribes, Martha and Howard Coray. So, based on the available evidence, we‚Äôre not reading what Joseph Sr. said about his dream, we‚Äôre reading what Lucy‚Äôs scribes wrote that Lucy said about her husband‚Äôs dream ‚Äî at a time when Joseph Sr. wasn‚Äôt around to verify it‚Äôs accuracy. Joseph Sr. died in 1840, while Lucy‚Äôs book wasn‚Äôt written until between 1844 and 1845 when Lucy would have been about 70 years old. We also don‚Äôt know when Joseph Sr. told Lucy about this dream. It could have been the morning after it happened more than 30 years prior in 1811, or he could have read 1 Nephi 8 years later and said, ‚ÄúHey Lucy, this sort of reminds me of a dream I once had.‚Äù We don‚Äôt know how accurate Lucy‚Äôs recollection was, how accurate Joseph Sr.‚Äôs recollection was, or how true the Coray‚Äôs final product was to Lucy‚Äôs original recollection.*

‚Äî *[Did Joseph Smith, Sr. and Lehi Have the Same Dream?](https://saintsunscripted.com/faith-and-beliefs/the-restoration-of-christs-church/did-joseph-smith-sr-lehi-have-same-dream/)*, Saints Unscripted

Where have I heard [[Kinderhook Plates#History of the Church|this explanation]] before?

Whenever Joseph Smith Jr said anything inconvenient or hard to explain, we can find out the name of a scribe associated with the document and [[Boasting#Third|just blame the scribe]]. The prophet *never* says anything conflicting or unclear‚Äî not when we have scribes! The scribes, of course, nail it every time whenever the prophet says something orthodox or predictable, or that hasn't had to be explained away later. That's when scribes are worth keeping around.
