# 🗒️ TODO
## Functional

- [ ] [[Changes#Enumeration of Changes|Book of Mormon Edition Changes]]
- [ ] Readability
	- [ ] Ellipses correction
	- [x] Indentation
	- [x] Centering images
	- [ ] CSS for quote citations
- [x] Static Navigation (w/ emoji)
- [x] Estimated time to read
	- [ ] Follow text color theming
- [x] Icon indicating outgoing links
	- [x] JQuery to fetch destination `favicon`

I'm not entirely certain, but I think I might be using ellipses improperly for a text medium. Ought to check.

### Em Dashes
One big item that I'm going to need to tackle *eventually* is my use of *em dashes*. They're not inherently bad or wrong, but my understanding is that they're a telltale sign of AI-generate content. I don't have a whole lot of experience using AI for text generation, but my limited experience is that yes, LLM's sure do like using em dashes more than biological humans in meatspace do. To date, I haven't used any AI on this site's content. I don't expect that I will, either.

If you were to look through the [commit history](https://github.com/b3-exmo/b3-exmo.github.io/commits/main/) for these pages of notes, you'd find how many times I use [HTML entities](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-entities.html) for unusual characters. That's because I can't be arsed to remember which unicode combination resolves to the character I'm imagining, so typing in `&mdash;` is easier. I also make [liberal use](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ab3-exmo%2Fb3-exmo.github.io+%22%26nbsp%3B%22&type=code) of `&nbsp;` for whitespace and line breaks. It makes the unrendered text harder to read, but it's meant to be consumed after rendering, so it's a non-issue (to me)

So at some point, I'll need to track down each and every em dash used to re-evaluate, because that's what *robots* use. *I guess*. It's on my to-do list.

## Topics
For many of these topics, I do have some existing notes, but they aren't in a presentable condition. Others, I've yet to write down some thoughts on. No, I’m not differentiating them here in this list. I have a day job, is all. I'll get to it.
