# 🪦 Afterlife
## Exaltation
> *We remain the same person we were prior to our death but without our body. I believe that eventually our spirit will reunite with our body. This is the resurrection. Our personal identity will remain with us forever. The faith, understanding, character, and qualities we develop on earth go with us. For all of us, death is an important transition to the next stage in God’s plan of happiness for His children. We continue to learn and progress. We continue to have interaction with others.*
> 
> *There is a hell for the evil and wicked. What that means would take too long to explain, but I do not see it as the paintings of Dante’s Inferno. Rather, it is a place where one comes to understand the terribleness of his actions, and guilt and remorse bring extreme sadness and sorrow. I do not believe it lasts forever except for a very, very few.*

### Ego
I find the idea of life after death to be fascinating. Or, extending beyond "life," the idea of consciousness after death. I think that the idea of unending consciousness sounds awful.

My experience with world religions is very narrow. I grew up in the United States, born and raised as a [[Name Mormon|Mormon]], a subcategory of Christianity. I can only offer conjecture at this point, but I'm curious about non-Christian faiths' teachings about what happens after death. I'll likely add more notes here once I take time to read about this topic. From my perspective as of early 2025, the Christian afterlife really seems to be appealing to human ego. 

Some strawman examples would be "I can't simply *cease to exist*. I'm too important to just *end*." "Some aspect of who I am must persist even after my mortal body expires." "Not only will I will continue to exist after death, but I will exist alongside the God whom I grew up revering. ... Also, people who disagree with me will *also* continue to exist, but they'll get the sad version."

A very cynical outlook on this teaching is that it's a tool to control one's subjects. It's a carrot-and-stick approach, of promising reward and punishment. A constable officer can levy punishment for crimes visibly committed. But what does an illiterate peasant do when no one is around to witness some misdoing? The ruling class can't have him or her getting too bold, so... Now Christianity teaches that there is an invisible, omniscient force, always present to witness your actions, and *even your thoughts.* You won't know it until after you die, but this divine presence is keeping track, and if you mess up badly enough, you'll *burn and suffer forever.* Conversely, you get to live a carefree existence, luxuriating forever if you're obedient to what your pastor says.

Trouble is, as with many promises that religions make, none of this gets realized until you're dead. And, once you're dead, there's no risk of you coming back to your religious clergy to say "hey, you lied to me!"

### Consciousness
Consider for a moment the possibility of immortality. If you were impervious to harm, you could do some fun stunts, chasing new sources of dopamine for a good, long while. In science fiction and fantasy, this condition leads to "everyone you've ever known or loved dies, leaving you alone." If you had unending life, remaining conscious and aware indefinitely, the novelty would at some point wear out. In this hypothetical scenario, you eventually outlive the planet you were on, drifting aimlessly in outer space, unable to suffocate or freeze&mdash; it honestly just sounds like a bad time.

Now, for another example to illustrate my point: solitary confinement is considered inhumane, cruel punishment ([1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement#Effects), [2](https://www.aclu.org/news/prisoners-rights/use-solitary-confinement-virginia-inhumane-and-unlawful), [3](https://www.britannica.com/topic/solitary-confinement), [4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/almost-addicted/201801/solitary-confinement-torture-pure-and-simple)). Why? You're left conscious and aware with no stimulation. Humans like novelty. Keeping someone confined and alone is widely considered *torturous*. Prisoners lose their sense of time passing, distorting their estimation of how long they've been confined. Three weeks can feel like ten years in a windowless, featureless room. You have absolutely no way to measure it, and it is maddening.

These would be fair comparisons *if* the scenario of Christianity's afterlife was simply continuing consciousness. The prospect of eternal life as described in Mormonism isn't so grim and ominous. Instead, it's... [vague](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2016/06/what-do-we-know-about-life-after-death?lang=eng&id=p26#p26). You'll just live forever, and your family will be there, having "[eternal joy](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/heaven)." What does not seem to be taken into consideration is that an eternity of *anything* would be torturous. Our consciousness is not able to fully comprehend eternity. If you [[#Families|take issue with your family]] for whatever reason, tough luck. At least you get to hang out with God and Jesus. Doing what for eternity? 🤷‍♂️ Playing Mario Kart, I guess. 

I realize that I likely sound insensitive or crass. For folks who do genuinely have a strong affinity for their family, this afterlife arrangement is a solid deal. True, humans don't always get along&mdash; inevitably upsetting each other for reasons ranging from egregious to annoying. Losing a close loved one is emotionally painful. The idea that they will again be alive and well truly is encouraging. If that hope is what helps you get through a depressive episode, or helps to bring closure to grieving, or simply prevent existential dread, then... it makes sense to want to believe that. I think the purpose of this religious teaching is to do exactly that&mdash; the "gospel," or [good news](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/gospels?lang=eng&id=p1#p1), is to inspire hope and optimism. It's very appealing to the human ego.

&nbsp;

### Families
What about folks who don’t want to stay with their family forever? I’m not part of this demographic, but there are people who are subject to abusive relationships in their family. Someone who gets beaten and raped by their father probably won’t see that Eternal Family™️ as a selling point. I would be okay with not spending eternity with a group of people like that.

If we’re all descendants of a common ancestor, Adam, then… where do we delineate family? If you’re Joseph Smith and your brother just passed away, that’s probably as far as the consideration got.

I would hypothetically be with my siblings, parents, and grandparents. What about *their* family? Are my grandparents' grandparents going to be counted as part of "my" family? Where would it end? Would my seventh cousin, Nth removed be part of the group I'm in? We'd share a common ancestor at some point, which ancestor would want to be with his or her family forever, including their descendants, and their descendants' respective descendants. How many generations back would it go? Wouldn’t that mean that everyone you see in Celestial Kingdom is family, and therefore being with family is a moot point?

I think the [Abrahamic Covenant](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) is [promised to anyone](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/abrahamic-covenant?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) "\[obedient to\] the laws and ordinances of the gospel," which I have been *assured* by my bishop that is what the "[[DC 132#4|new and everlasting covenant]]" means.

> *And it was in the night time when the Lord spake these words unto me: I will multiply thee, and thy seed after thee, like unto these; and if thou canst count the number of sands, so shall be the number of thy seeds.*

&mdash; [Abraham 3:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14)

A person can receive all the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant—even if he or she is not a literal descendant of Abraham—by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel.

&nbsp;

Do we draw a line somewhere between Homo Sapiens and other humankind precursors? Do Neanderthals and Homo Erectus count as family, if we can trace our lineage to them? ... What's that? [[Historicity|They don't exist]]? *How convenient*.

&nbsp;

### For women
[[Doctrines/Polygamy/Polygamy|Polygamy]] is already kind of a raw deal for mortal women, but early LDS leadership pretty strongly suggests that God and Jesus both are polygamists. If we’re spirit sons and daughters of God, it’s kind of odd to think that Heavenly Mother doesn’t refer to one individual. Could be one of many. Each of us are from the same heavenly father, and there is a non-zero chance we’re from different heavenly mothers, if the second Prophet of the church is to be believed.

If Polygamy is an eternal law, and [[Becoming Gods|we are to become like God]], then… that means that exaltation for women is to be a spiritual breeder, who shall not be named or known, and her children cannot commune with her. Does that sound like heaven? Watching your own children suffer through arduous trials on earth, and being able to offer no comfort, knowing they’re forbidden from even talking to you, or even knowing about you? Does that sound like heaven?

&nbsp;

### Polygamy
[[Brigham Young]] is a prophet, yes or no?

When he teaches that [[Theology|Elohim]] and Jesus are both polygamists, should be believe the spokesperson of Elohim and Jesus?

> *“Plural marriage is the patriarchal order of marriage lived by God and others who reign in the Celestial Kingdom.”*

— *[Brigham Young and His Wives and The True Story of Plural Marriage](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL28674026M/Brigham_Young_and_his_wives_and_the_true_story_of_plural_marriage)*, John J. Stewart, 1961, p. 41

&nbsp;

Brigham Young has a fair amount of other statements on the godhead being polygamist, but those quotes fit better [[Doctrines/Polygamy/Polygamy#God is polygamist, too|in that section]].
