# 🥈 Second Coming
The apostle Paul was pretty sure that Jesus was coming back any minute now... back in 50 - 60 CE. Much of Christianity has behaved as if the second coming were imminent. And yet, at the time of writing this note, we're at the end of 2024. I think Christ was crucified in or around 34 CE, so we're approaching 2,000 consecutive years of "any minute now, keeeeeep watching!" I'm not qualified to draw the line for all of humanity, but I will ask at what point do we stop living in fear?

&nbsp;

## Old Testament
> ... *The new birth is mentioned in the Bible nine times; baptism is mentioned 52 times, repentance is mentioned 89, but ==the second coming of Christ is mentioned over 1,500 times in the Old Testament== and 300 times in the New Testament. If God thought this subject that important, he must have wanted us to do something about it[.]”*

— Quote attributed to *Sterling W. Sill, in Conference Report, Apr. 1966, 19*; copied from *[Chapter 36: The Lord’s Second Coming](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/36-second-coming?lang=eng&id=p22#p22), Doctrines of the Gospel Student Manual*

I am so baffled as to why Old Testament prophets were advised *at all* of Jesus' second coming, when at that age, Jesus hadn't arrived for the first time yet. Jesus' prophesied birth would be well outside the lifespan of anyone to hear an Old Testament prophet talk about it. So, let's tell God's followers about the *second* time He'll come by, at a minimum of 2,024 years after the event you won't live to see! How is that relevant to *anyone* in those times? Isn't a prophet meant to communicate God's will to *living* contemporaries? If the value proposition of a prophet is timely guidance, we shouldn't have any Old Testament prophets talking about you and me today. If we do, that makes modern prophets irrelevant.

God seems to be revealing ambiguous information to His chosen prophets, and then getting upset when people don't uniformly agree with those prophets. God handles this inevitable disagreement by revoking priesthood authority, sending the world into apostasy. "Now *nobody* is right 😤" What the hell, God? If you had actually told us something comprehensible...

&nbsp;

Really, though— if God wanted Old Testament prophets to hype up Jesus' *Second Coming*, don't you think God would be more proactive in [[Bible#Imperfect translation|preserving those documented prophecies]] for our modern day? No? The Bible is sometimes mistranslated, due to wicked mens' agency? Isn't a central tenant of Mormonism that people [won't be punished](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) for their ancestors' misdoings?

I recall reading about contemporaries in ancient Jerusalem refusing to believe that Jesus was the Messiah during His ministry, because His humble origins didn't line up with the Old Testament prophecies about the *second* coming. I don't recall if it was Sadducees or Pharisees, but... perhaps that misunderstanding could have been avoided altogether if prophets of old hadn't skipped ahead 3,000 years? If those prophets were simply to be a mouthpiece for God, relaying divine information, then I would attribute that misunderstanding to God telling us feeble-minded mortals the wrong thing at the wrong time. What the hell, God?

&nbsp;

## When will it be?
We have not one, but two hard & fast time frames for Jesus' second coming. First, one that is a bit more nebulous:

&nbsp;

### While Joseph is a Priest
> *[Joseph Smith] washed the feet of all the Elders wiping them with the towel, his father presenting himself the President asked of him a blessing before he would wash his feet which he obtained by the laying on of his fathers hands, pronouncing upon his head that ==he should continue in his Priests office untill Christ come==[.]*

&mdash; *[Minutes, 22–23 January 1833](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minutes-22-23-january-1833/2?highlight=untill%20Christ%20come)*, Joseph Smith Papers

&nbsp;

If you follow that link, make sure to double-check *Footnote 7*:

> *It is unclear why Joseph Smith Sr. used this specific language or what it meant. Perhaps it referred to JS’s role as a high priest or his role as president of the high priesthood.*

&nbsp;

So... Joseph will be in a theologically authoritative position until Christ's coming. Maybe. Smith Senior was, at this time, not yet the [presiding patriarch](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/joseph-smith-sr), but he was [a high priest](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/john-whitmer-history-1831-circa-1847/32) at this point. Should his words be treated as prophetic? I could see an argument made both for and against. Let's look at some more concrete examples.

&nbsp;

### 1890
> *I was once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following:*
> 
> *Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art ==eighty-five years old==, thou shalt see the face of the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and trouble me no more on this matter.*
> 
> *I was left thus, without being able to decide whether this coming referred to the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or whether I should die and thus see his face.*
> 
> *I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that time.*

— *[D&C 130:14-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p14-p17#p14)*, 2 April 1843

Joseph was born in 1805, so `1805 + 85 = 1890`.

Once could argue that there's enough of a caveat in there; since Joseph did not live to be 85, the prophecy is invalidated. [D&C 3:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) is at odds with that claim: "*The works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught.*" Who would have guessed that the mob that killed Joseph could thwart God's plans, and overrule His machinations! It seems that Jesus *was scheduled* to stop by in 1890, but since Joseph got martyred ([[Joseph Smith#How do we define “martyr”?|maybe]]) God changed His mind...?

Both of these passages can't be true. But if one or the other is false, we might begin to question whether or not Smith was a prophet. Also, let's not overlook God Himself telling Joseph to "trouble me no more on this matter." We're being told to [[Anxiety#Prayer|stop bothering God]] with prayerful questions? What the hell, God?

&nbsp;

### 1891
In a meeting on Feb 14, 1835, [[Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith]] definitively stated:

> *. . . and those who went to Zion, with a determination to lay down their lives, if necessary, it was the will of God that they should be ordained, to the ministry, and go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time, or the ==Coming of the Lord which was nigh even fifty six years== should wind up the scene.*

— *[History, 1838–1856, volume B-1](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-b-1-1-september-1834-2-november-1838/18)*, [1 September 1834–2 November 1838], p. 564

Well... `1835 + 56 = 1891`. One could argue that 14 Feb & 2 April allows for some displacement of months, so it could be 1890 as the previous prophecy describes. Or, we could focus on the qualifier "should" as not being definitive enough, despite the prophet of the restoration speaking in an official capacity, he's still just [[Prophets|speaking as a man]].

Either way, that year has come and gone. It'd be odd if any [church leader after 1891](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?facet=general-conference&lang=eng&query=second+coming&page=1) were to [hype up how we need to prepare for it](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/topics/second-coming?lang=eng) in the non-specific future. After all, [no one knows](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) when it will be!

&nbsp;

### Some non-specific time
Nevermind, we won't settle on a date, but it's *really* going to happen, and it'll happen *really* soon.

&nbsp;

> *Jesus Christ’s ascension into heaven before the eyes of his disciples was accompanied by the promise that in like manner he would come again. ==The second coming of Jesus Christ is nigh at hand==, as the signs of the Second Coming are being fulfilled this very day.*

Hales, First Quorum of the Seventy, General Conference 1979 April; see also Hales use this exact verbiage [again in 1994](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1994/04/the-unique-message-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) as an Apostle

&nbsp;

> *Our message to the world, which we have been proclaiming for more than 140 years, is that God lives and that Jesus was and is the living Christ; that the heavens have been opened to man; that the Father and the Son have appeared in this dispensation; that the plan of life and salvation has been restored; that ==the time of the Savior’s second coming is near at hand==; that the Lord, through his church, is preparing the way for that appearance; and that the only way in which peace can come to the earth is through obedience to the restored teachings of Jesus Christ.*

&nbsp;

> *My dear brothers and sisters, ==in a coming day, Jesus Christ will return to the earth as the millennial Messiah==. So today I call upon you to rededicate your lives to Jesus Christ. I call upon you to help gather scattered Israel and to prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord. I call upon you to talk of Christ, testify of Christ, have faith in Christ, and rejoice in Christ!*

&nbsp;

> ... *the Spirit made clear to me that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is uniquely empowered and commissioned to accomplish the necessary ==preparations for the Lord’s Second Coming==; indeed, ==it was restored for that purpose==.*

&nbsp;

There are way too many examples to draw from without bloating this page of notes. Here's an [internal search](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?facet=general-conference&lang=eng&page=1&query=second+coming) and an [external search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Achurchofjesuschrist.org%2Fstudy%2Fgeneral-conference+%22second+coming%22). Church leadership has demonstrated that they believe this is a topic worth discussing, even when there has been *no new information* for 190 years. It'll be *any minute* now. See, look, there are wars and rumors of wars. There was an earthquake. We're in the *latter days*— it's in our name, after all. President Nelson uttered the words "in a coming day," which phrasing is just the right level of vague. Could be tomorrow, could be in the year 4096. Both outcomes are "in a coming day." No other church leader has uttered [that combination of words](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?facet=general-conference&lang=eng&page=1&query=%22in+a+coming+day%22) before, so it must be prophetic! Now *get your ass to the temple*!

&nbsp;

## Signs
> *And Jesus answered, and said unto them: Take heed that no man deceive you;*
> 
> *For many shall come in my name, saying—I am Christ—and shall deceive many;*

— *[Joseph Smith — Matthew 1:5-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5)*

Bold of you, the church claiming to represent Christ, to accuse others of saying they misrepresent Christ.

&nbsp;

One of my go-to responses for the "signs of the times" to validate prophetic words is "when have these things ==not== been true?" Let's take a look at some signs described in the Gospel Principles manual.

&nbsp;

> ***Wickedness, War, and Turmoil***
> 
> *Many of the signs are terrifying and dreadful. The prophets have warned that ==the earth will experience great turmoil, wickedness, war, and suffering==. The prophet Daniel said that the time before the Second Coming would be ==a time of trouble such as the earth has never known== (see [Daniel 12:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12.1?lang=eng#p1)). The Lord said, “The love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound” ([D&C 45:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.27?lang=eng#p27)). “And ==all things shall be in commotion==; and … fear shall come upon all people” ([D&C 88:91](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.91?lang=eng#p91)). We can expect ==earthquakes, disease, famines, great storms, lightnings, and thunder== (see [Matthew 24:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.7?lang=eng#p7); [D&C 88:90](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.90?lang=eng#p90)). Hailstorms will destroy the crops of the earth (see [D&C 29:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.16?lang=eng#p16)).*

> . . .

> *Many of these signs are being fulfilled. Wickedness is everywhere. ==Nations are constantly at war==. Earthquakes and other calamities are occurring. Many people now suffer from devastating ==storms, drought, hunger, and diseases==. We can be certain that these calamities will become more severe before the Lord comes.*

— *[Chapter 43: Signs of the Second Coming](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-43-signs-of-the-second-coming?id=p5,p7&lang=eng#p5)*

There will be earthquakes and thunder? *Holy shit*, what a novel development. There had never been earthquakes nor thunderstorms prior to this prophecy's delivery, and each subsequent lightning strike or influenza outbreak surely must have a deeper meaning now. Truly prophetic.

There will be wars and rumors of wars? Please, tell me of a time in recorded history when there have been neither wars nor rumors of wars. Take as much time as you need. Was this the case in 30 CE? Any year *before* 30 CE? Because if it happened before, concurrent to, and after this prophecy, then what the hell are we meant to understand from these words?

&nbsp;

> *==We live, brothers and sisters, in the days preceding the Lord’s Second Coming==, a time long anticipated by believers through the ages. ==We live in days of wars and rumors of wars==, days of natural disasters, days when the world is pulled by confusion and commotion.*

— *[Thy Kingdom Come](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/04/thy-kingdom-come?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)*, Elder Neil L. Andersen, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, General Conference 2015 April

&nbsp;

> *Remember that the fulness of Christ’s ministry lies in the future. ==The prophecies of His Second Coming have yet to be fulfilled==. We are just building up to the climax of this last dispensation—when the Savior’s Second Coming becomes a reality.*

— *[The Future of the Church: Preparing the World for the Savior’s Second Coming](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2020/04/the-future-of-the-church-preparing-the-world-for-the-saviors-second-coming?lang=eng&id=p6#p6)*, President Russell M. Nelson, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, General Conference April 2020

Is there a difference between *signs* of the second coming, and *prophecies* of the second coming? 

&nbsp;

If [these signs](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/04/preparation-for-the-second-coming?lang=eng&id=p8-p18#p8) are critical to God's purposes, God's grand scheme and plan, would it be too bold of me to say that He did kind of a shit job of selecting what signs for us to watch for? It's as if He's saying "you'll know Jesus is coming soon when things are *exactly as they have been* for centuries."

Being "certain that these calamities will become more severe before the Lord comes" sounds like it could be interpreted as a reinforcement that climate change isn't real, but Jesus' promise of "any minute now" is a more reliable explanation. "There will be wars. People will be *mean to each other.* All things shall be in commotion." I'm not being snarky, this is not rhetorical: what am I supposed to do with this information? When have these things *not* been true? Buy that huge SUV, subsist on beef— you deserve it because Jesus is coming to fix the world, absolving us of any and all responsibility for His creations.

&nbsp;

I don't want to be needlessly cynical and snarky, but I'll make up some nonsensical examples that, to me, fit this same energy:

- "People will ingest food, and lo, they shall also defecate, even in the same day." — prophecy fulfilled hourly by Taco Bell
- "And the sun, yea even the very light of our heavens, will rise up from the east, and it shall thence set in the west. Even so, amen." Framing it in 16th century English makes it seem profound, so it must be special *this time*!
- "One land shall experience both a drought and abundance, a dearth and a flood, even amid the same hour." California shares borders with both Oregon and Arizona. It has rainy forests and deserts, and both climates exist "in the same land."

&nbsp;

## How many times?
I mean, Jesus did (reportedly) [appear physically on Earth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) to personally tell Joseph Smith that [everyone else is wrong](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19).

&nbsp;

> *==The Savior will make several appearances before His Second Coming== to all the world.*
> 
> *==1==. Christ will appear at Adam-ondi-Ahman (see [Daniel 7:9–10, 13–14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/7.9-10,13-14?lang=eng#p9); [D&C 116](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116?lang=eng)).*
> 
> *==2==. The Savior will appear to those in the New Jerusalem in America (see [3 Nephi 21:23–25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21.23-25?lang=eng#p23); [D&C 45:66–67](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.66-67?lang=eng#p66)).*
> 
> *==3==. The Savior will appear to the Jews in Jerusalem (see [D&C 45:48, 51–53](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.48,51-53?lang=eng#p48); [Zechariah 12:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/12.10?lang=eng#p10); [14:2–5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/14.2-5?lang=eng#p2)).*
> 
> *==4==. The Lord will appear in glory to all mankind (see [D&C 45:44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.44?lang=eng#p44); [101:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.23?lang=eng#p23); [Matthew 24:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.30?lang=eng#p30); [Isaiah 40:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/40.5?lang=eng#p5); [JST, Revelation 1:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-rev/1.7?lang=eng#p7)).*

— *[Chapter 36: The Lord’s Second Coming](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/36-second-coming?lang=eng&id=p4-p8#p4)*, Doctrines of the Gospel Student Manual

I, uh... don't...

I don't think that's how [cardinality](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cardinality) works.

Jesus appeared once by being born of Mary, specifically outlined what will happen leading up to His next appearance, and then sneaks in up to four interim appearances. Meaning His Second Coming will actually be maybe His sixth or seventh visitation. I'm not clear if item #4 in that list— appearing in glory to all mankind— counts as an appearance before the Second Coming.

&nbsp;

## The Millennium
What, you mean living in your parents' basement after the avocado market crash? lmao got 'em

![image](../img/fake-laugh.gif){: .center}

&nbsp;

> *When Christ returns, ==all people will know it==. The prophet Isaiah declared, “And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together”. This monumental event will mark the beginning of a glorious 1,000-year period, known as the Millennium, when Jesus will reign personally on the earth, Satan will have no power, and all people will live in peace and joy.*

— Gospel Study Guide: Topics & Questions, [Second Coming of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/second-coming-of-jesus-christ-study-guide?lang=eng); see original for scriptural citations

I recall hearing as a seminary student that at Christ's second coming, it will be so undeniably obvious to every human on earth ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34?lang=eng&id=p7-p8#p7), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p2-p3#p2), [3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p10-p13#p10)). We've got a flowery statement [along the lines of](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p104#p104) "every knee will bow, every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ," even those dirty, unwashed heathens who aren't [[Skin of blackness#2 Nephi 5|white and delightsome]].

&nbsp;

I also recall hearing a fellow named Paul describing that "[the day of the Lord](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/5?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) so cometh as a thief in the night." Metaphors don't translate very well across languages, so we're left with multiple possible interpretations of what this means. If it means that Jesus will sneak in unbeknownst to the masses, then Paul's statement is at odds with Joseph Smith. Maybe this is one of those convenient times where the Bible [[Bible#Article of Faith|isn't translated correctly]]. 

> *The Lord’s coming will be as a thief in the night ==to those who are in spiritual darkness==. Paul described the Saints as “the children of light, and the children of the day.” Paul gave them guidelines for living as Saints. Through God’s help, the Saints will be found blameless at the Second Coming.*

— [Lesson 46: 1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/new-testament-teacher-manual/the-epistles-of-paul-the-apostle-to-the-thessalonians/lesson-46-1-thessalonians-and-2-thessalonians?lang=eng&id=figure2_p5#figure2_p5), New Testament Teacher Manual

Oh. It'll only be "as a thief in the night" to those in spiritual darkness, then? Thanks, that clears things right up. What the hell is spiritual darkness? I've seen *light* symbolized as illumination, clarity and knowledge, and while my [searches](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?lang=eng&query=%22spiritual+darkness%22) didn't land on what I'd call a definition, I guess it's synonymous with apostasy. ([1.1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-spencer-w-kimball/chapter-21?lang=eng&id=p18#p18), [1.2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-spencer-w-kimball/chapter-21?lang=eng&id=p28#p28), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/darkness-spiritual?lang=eng)) Still, Smith said in no uncertain terms that "all people will know it." 🤷

&nbsp;

> *And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a thief in the night—*
> 
> *Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the children of light, and that day shall not overtake you as a thief.*

— [D&C 106:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/106?lang=eng&id=p4-p5#p4)

Well... Maybe Jesus will arrive for the ~~seventh~~ second time and it actually *will* be discreet?

&nbsp;

> *The wicked who are living at the time of the Second Coming of the Lord ==will be destroyed in the flesh==. They, along with the wicked who are already dead, will have to wait until the last resurrection. All of the remaining dead will rise to meet God. They will either inherit the telestial kingdom or ==be cast into outer darkness with Satan== (see [D&C 76:32–33, 81–112](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p32-p33,81-p112#p32)).*

&nbsp;

### Death Follows Jesus
There seems to be many prophecies and signs surrounding Jesus' arrival, whether for the first, "second," or Nth time. An uncomfortable number of those arrivals are accompanied by mass death and destruction.

#### Birth
At Jesus' birth, one King Herod may or may not have [massacred](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/2?lang=eng&id=p16-p18#p16) "all the children that were in Bethlehem... from two years old and under." From what I understand, there isn't [any historic, contemporary evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents#History_and_theology) of this happening, but Matthew chapter 2 sure seems insistent that it happened. Seems like a good way to kneecap your own kingdom's economy. If everyone—soldier, peasant, noble—all had their children 2 & under murdered, how long do you think that king would remain in power? That would fuck up an entire generation. Herod doing this would have resounding effects that would have been recorded by many more sources than just this one. 

Doing this would effectively leave Herod without an effective military fifteen to twenty years down the road. If word gets out that Herod's territory has a decimated population of able-bodied soldiers, you can bet that any and all political enemies would jump on that vulnerability. The kingdom's workforce of farmers and laborers would have a big gap, affecting both agriculture and commerce, gimping the economy. But, hey, at least that prophesied messiah is out of the way, right? No chance that the target would have, you know, [fled to Egypt](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/2?id=p13-p14&lang=eng#p13) until things cooled off. Better hope that word doesn't get out. If the citizens have had their tyrannical ruler summarily execute their children once, would they fear that it happens again? Wouldn't that fresh memory of having your toddler slaughtered inhibit your desire to have another one? What's to say Herod wouldn't do it again?

The legend is that Herod does all of this based on the rumor that a baby might overthrow him once the prophesied messiah reaches adulthood. This is such a preposterous response to an absurd threat.

Twenty years from the time of writing this note, I'll be in my mid-fifties. There is a non-zero chance that at that time, I'll befall some violent fate at the hands of someone who is, today, a baby. Imagine this happening for whichever local government official that comes to your mind&mdash;if he or she had the power to, would this (purely hypothetical) person round up all children in [the tri-state area](https://phineasandferb.fandom.com/wiki/Tri-State_Area) and enact infanticide *just in case* the future unproven threat were valid? I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a more effective way to piss off every individual taxpayer. This offending leader, imagined or real, would have angry mobs storming the offices within 24 hours.

&nbsp;

I'm getting off track. [Matthew 2:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/2?lang=eng&id=p17-p18#p17) says that this was a fulfilment of a prophecy. I'd also like to point out [verses 12 & 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/2?lang=eng&id=p12-p13#p12) describing God arranging for this to happen. Rather than defuse the tension, God has Joseph leave, which pisses off Herod, and leads to *all children getting murdered*. Was this an oversight? Surely God wasn't blindsided by this development. Surely God *knew* how Herod would react. I bring it up to iterate that when Jesus was born, some untold number of children got killed.

Now, let's celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace!

Even though having Jesus die on the cross was part of [[Theology#God's Plan|God's Plan]]™ all along, He still got real pissed that it happened.

To signify that Jesus had been born and was crucified, shit was *going down* in America.

I'm Jesus Christ, by the way. *I killed everyone you've ever known or loved.* Now, who wants some 𝓮𝓽𝓮𝓻𝓷𝓪𝓵 𝓵𝓲𝓯𝓮? 😄"

Yeah, man. You've got my attention. Don't think for a minute that I'm going to forget what you did, or that I'm doing what you say for [[Theology#God's Respectability|any purpose other than self-preservation]].

&nbsp;

Think back for a moment for what was happening to Jesus three days prior over in Jerusalem:

> *Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.*

— *[Luke 23:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/23?id=p34&lang=eng#p34)*

Jesus had a reputation for being benevolent and forgiving, even as he is actively being tortured to death. He seemed like a "big picture" kind of guy, recognizing that these Roman soldiers are still spirit sons of God, and are short-sighted enough to not understand the eternal implications of what's happening...even though this was *literally* what God had planned to happen all along.

Contrast this observation with "fuck you, Nephites! I'm going to raze your cities because there were wicked people in them!" and ask yourself if that seems characteristic of who we read about in the New Testament.

What if those Roman soldiers hadn't been conditioned to [just follow orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders#Nuremberg_Trials_after_World_War_II), though? Wasn't Jesus' conviction and crucifixion necessary (for one reason or another)? Did those soldiers need forgiving if they were an integral part of the Plan of Salvation, fulfilling prophecies from the Old Testament? Would they otherwise be condemned for *not* killing Jesus?

We should live each day the best we can, just as Jesus taught when He was on the earth. ==We can look to the prophet for guidance and follow his counsel==. We can live worthy to have the Holy Ghost guide us. Then we will look forward to the Savior’s coming with happiness and not with fear.

### Ten Virgins
This parable has been revisited and expounded [numerous times](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?facet=general-conference&lang=eng&query=%22ten+virgins%22&page=1). Here's a link to [Matthew 25:1-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p1-p13#p1) if you'd like to see the source text for yourself. I bring this up to illustrate that [verse 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=13#p13) wraps it up with a nice conclusion: "watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh." Sounds like it's commanding constant vigilance for that anticipated "any minute now" event. [D&C 45:56](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=56#p56) says that at the second coming, "shall the parable be fulfilled[.]" Nobody knows when it will be.

I'm certain that the [parable](https://www.wordnik.com/words/parable) was more meaningful to Jesus' contemporaries than it is to us today. Folks excitedly gathering to meet "the bridegroom" surely had more cultural relevance back then. I also understand that one word can have different meanings depending on context, but something occurs to me now as I revisit this biblical passage: that is, the bridegroom [saying](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) "I know you not."

Again, the cultural significance here must have been more meaningful 2,000 years ago, but... we do have precedent of "Joseph ==knew== [Mary] not," where "know" is definitively interpreted as a euphemism for "sexual relations." ([1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/new-testament-student-study-guide/the-gospel-according-to-saint-matthew/matthew-1?lang=eng&id=aside1_p12-aside1_p11#aside1_p12), [2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/new-testament-seminary-teacher-manual-2023/matthew-1-18-25-luke-1-26-35?lang=eng&id=title9-p35#title9)) Must have been a wild party those virgins were missing out on. What does that imply for the parable? We're meant to watch for the bridegroom's arrival, so he can "know" us? 😏
