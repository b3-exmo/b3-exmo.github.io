# 🔗 Sources & More Material

[lds-general-conference.org](https://www.lds-general-conference.org/): Does not appear to be an officially sanctioned site

[fairlatterdaysaints.org](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/): FAIR, Faithful Answers & Informed Responses, is an unofficial apologetics site; attempts to address difficult questions and controversies. Provides primary sources for problematic documents. The De Facto standard for defending The Truth ™️ from those evildoers.

... It's maybe unofficial. I've encountered claims that writers for the game are paid by the church, but I haven't looked into it to verify those claims.

[catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/): Appears to be part of official church domain.

When you first load up and select the search bar, this popup appears:

> **Collection Policy**
> 
> _The Church History Library collects materials by or about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members. These materials come from a wide spectrum of sources and represent numerous points of view. Users of the catalog should not assume that the Church or the Library endorses every item in the collection._

lol. lmao.

[churchofjesuschrist.org/media/publications](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/publications?lang=eng): Media publications. PDFs of scripture, proclamations, manuals, president teachings, etc
## Joseph Smith Papers Project

Establish legitimacy of later sources:

[Official LDS Newsroom](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/new-publishing-imprint-set-to-boost-mormon-scholarship) opens this announcement by saying:

>“The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced today the establishment of The Church Historian’s Press, a new imprint for publishing works related to the Church’s origin and growth.”

[https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/) is part of this domain.

Both The Church Historian’s Press and Joseph Smith Papers appear to be legitimate, LDS leadership-owned sources of information.

## [Deseret Management Corporation](https://www.deseretmanagement.com/#our-companies)
>Deseret Management Corporation (DMC) is a for-profit company affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[Deseret Management, _Careers_](https://www.deseretmanagement.com/careers)

One could rightfully argue that "affiliated with" doesn't mean "owned by." It'd be a shame if one of its subsidiaries [[#Deseret News|outright stated that DMC is owned by the church]], wouldn't it?
### Deseret Digital Media
[Owns KSL](https://www.deseretdigital.com/ksl-news) and its subsidiaries
[Owns Utah.com](https://www.deseretdigital.com/utah-dotcom), tourism site
### Deseret News
>The Deseret News is a subsidiary of the [Deseret Management Corporation](http://www.deseretmanagement.com/), which is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

[About Us](https://www.deseret.com/pages/about-us/), Deseret News

### So what?
Disregarding all the times I'd been assured that Deseret News / Book was not owned by the church, the idea that a religion has a for-profit branch doesn't sit well with me. I thought religions were meant to operate by donation?

Being owned by the church itself carries some connotations- I'm not going to imply that every KSL article is screened & approved by the 12 apostles, but the connection is close enough for us common folk to read a level of complicity in what Deseret Book publishes. I don't presently know much about their quality control process, but Deseret wouldn't publish things the Church would vehemently disagree with, would it? It's not an independent business, it's owned by the corporate office of the LDS Church. 



## Other non-official materials

[A Careful Examination](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/): Looks like another Github Pages compendium

[LDS Discussions](https://www.ldsdiscussions.com/): Fantastic, well-researched dives into a variety of topics. Those pages are awfully long, so get comfy before reading

[Thoughts on things and stuff](https://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/topics/): Sounds vague, feels like a muse for doctrinal thoughts

[Mormonism under the microscope](https://www.mormonismunderthemicroscope.com/): Haven't explored much, looks like a topical document for various claims / controversies

[Zelph on the Shelf](https://zelphontheshelf.com/): One of the early blogs I encountered that offers critical insights of LDS doctrine. As of 2024 March, appears to be offline- hoping it comes back in the future 🥺
Bonus link: [The Millennials' Brief Guide to the CES Letter](https://zelphontheshelf.com/the-millennials-brief-guide-to-the-ces-letter/) is one I encountered early on (late 2018) when i was trying to find some "both sides" analyses of the CES Letter.

[floodlit.org](https://floodlit.org/): Info on sexual abusers & coverups within LDS church
