# üßî Jesus and The Church

‚Äî [Why a Church?](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/kevin-s-hamilton/why-a-church/), Elder Kevin Hamilton, General Authority Seventy, BYU Speech January 24, 2023

&nbsp;

Because The Savior is not disseminating His policies or dispositions to us common lay people, it‚Äôs not 100% clear what Jesus Christ‚Äôs opinions or dispositions *are*. Instead, we‚Äôre told that Jesus is revealing those [[Doctrine|policies]] to the top leadership of the LDS church. So there isn‚Äôt *really* a meaningful difference by that metric. Problems arise when we entertain the possibility that maybe these nonagenarians don‚Äôt actually obtain and disseminate Jesus‚Äô will. What do we do, then? Do we abandon critical thinking and refuse to entertain the idea, or do we abandon critical thinking and simply do as we are told?

This sounds like a [[Culture#Thought Stoppers|thought-stopping]] technique. "You don‚Äôt like what I said over the pulpit? Well, I represent Jesus, so that means you don‚Äôt like what Jesus said." Ostensibly, yes, but that extension of logic relies on the belief that this guy actually does represent Jesus. 

So how do we know? Well, first we need to interpolate a variety of factors‚Äî you must read the Book of Mormon up to and including [[Cognitive Bias#Moroni's Promise|Moroni 10]]. If you extrapolate that to address you, today in \[current year\], next you pray and watch for *anything that isn‚Äôt bad* as a sign of divine favor. Since that non-specific response is indisputable proof, you extend that to mean that Joseph Smith was called of God. Disregard any confusion between Smith‚Äôs passing and Brigham Young‚Äôs presidency; Nelson is now the prophet of God, which means Hamilton is a ‚ÄúGeneral Authority Seventy,‚Äù and since he‚Äôs standing at a pulpit at his own church‚Äôs university, what he says is true and divinely inspired. Unless he says something that might make the church look bad, then he‚Äôs just a regular guy [[Prophets|speaking as a man]] and shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously. 

&nbsp;

Let's assume he is divinely inspired, and put that wisdom to practice: ‚Äúwe need 2 volunteer families to clean the savior on Saturday morning, please!‚Äù

As a full-time missionary:

- Jesus Christ made a rule against giving money to impoverished children.
- The Savior threatened to not help me find the people who needed his help if I failed to wake up exactly on time.

&nbsp;

In broader contexts:

- Jesus Christ repeatedly calls [sexual predators to positions of trust and power](https://floodlit.org/accused/).
- Jesus Christ was happy about the results of the Bisee Arizona case. ([1](https://www.deseret.com/2023/11/8/23953246/statement-from-church-arizona-sex-abuse-case-lawsuit/), [2](https://www.ksl.com/article/50782370/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-church-in-arizona-sex-abuse-case-citing-clergy-penitent-exception))
- Jesus Christ doesn't want to pay for background checks for people who work with children unless it's a legal requirement.
- The Savior hires lawyers to protect his good name‚Äîeven if it ends up hurting people who have already been victimized.

&nbsp;

Culturally:

- Jesus Christ thinks women will be the most happy when completely financially dependent on their husbands.
- The Lord is more upset when people have consensual sex outside of marriage than when a person gets raped by their spouse.
- Jesus Christ asks me to clean his house for free every Saturday.
- The Savior of the World is *very concerned* about what kind of underwear I wear.
- The Lord threatens to keep my away from my family for the rest of eternity if I drink coffee.
- Jesus Christ decided to let black people into heaven starting in 1978.
- Jesus Christ decided that wives don't need to covenant to obey their respective husbands in 2019.
- The Savior continually says he'll be back soon‚Äîjust to keep me on my toes.
- Jesus Christ _really_ doesn't want two loving adults to be allowed to be married if they both have the same kind of genitalia.
- The Lord [[SEC#SEC PR statement|lied to the US government for over 20 years]] so that no one would know how much money he had.
- The Savior of mankind demands money from impoverished people. Sometimes he called it 'fire insurance.' [1](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t6e7), [2](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gordon-b-hinckley/need-not-fear-coming/), [3](https://archive.org/details/improvementera1204unse/page/251/mode/1up?q=insurance))
- Jesus Christ has a multi-billion dollar stock portfolio.
