# 🧍‍♂️ No Official Stance
The LDS church claims authority to definitively speak for and in behalf of God Himself.

The LDS church has also been very specific and particular about things like [[Word-of-Wisdom|coffee]] and [[Garments|underpants]], but there are some topics that they simply take no position on. I find that fascinating. Many of these things are contentious, and humanity might benefit from an authoritative voice from God&mdash;our heavenly father&mdash;to tell us what He intends for us.

And so, here are some things that I've encountered that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sees as too great of a legal risk to comment on.

Cowards. Do they speak for God or not?

### Evolution
> *The Church has no official position on the theory of evolution.*

— [What does the Church believe about evolution?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2016/10/to-the-point/what-does-the-church-believe-about-evolution?lang&=eng&id=p1#p1), New Era, 2016 October

&nbsp;

> *Leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the time did not take an official stance on the theory of evolution, but they did take steps to clarify the Church’s teachings related to human origins. In 1909, President Joseph F. Smith and his counselors in the First Presidency published an official declaration entitled “The Origin of Man.” Drafted by Elder Orson F. Whitney, the declaration affirmed our divine nature as children of God. The next year, President Smith urged Church leaders not to undertake “to say how much of evolution is true, or how much is false.”*

### Stem-cell Research
> *The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has no official position on the moment that human life begins. Further, the Church has not taken a position on the issue of embryonic stem-cell research.*

— [Embryonic Stem-Cell Research](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/embryonic-stem-cell-research), Church Newsroom, 26 May 2005

&nbsp;

> *The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not taken a position regarding the use of embryonic stem cells for research purposes. The absence of a position should not be interpreted as support for or opposition to any other statement made by Church members, whether they are for or against embryonic stem cell research.*

&nbsp;

### Identity
#### Biological Sex
> *Temple ordinances are not needed or performed for children who die before birth. This does not deny the possibility that these children may be part of the family in the eternities. Parents are encouraged to trust the Lord and seek His comfort.*

— [Children Who Die before Birth (Stillborn and Miscarried Children)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng#title_number130), General Handbook &sect; 38.7.3

&nbsp;

> *Questions about membership records, priesthood ordination, and temple ordinances for youth or adults who were born with sexual ambiguity should be directed to the Office of the First Presidency.*

— [Individuals Whose Sex at Birth Is Not Clear](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&id=title_number125-p426#title_number125), General Handbook &sect; 38.7.7

&nbsp;

#### Sexual Orientation
> *The Church does not take a position on the causes of same-sex attraction.*

— [Same-Sex Attraction and Same-Sex Behavior](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&id=p791#p791)

&nbsp;

#### Gender Dysmorphia
> *Some people feel their inner sense of gender does not align with their biological sex at birth. The Church does not take a position on the causes of these feelings.*

— [Individuals Who Identify as Transgender](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&id=p404#p404), General Handbook &sect; 38.6.23

&nbsp;

### Health
#### Plastic Surgery
> *The Church has no official position on cosmetic plastic surgery in general, but Church leaders have taught principles that can guide us in such matters.*

— [What is the Church’s view on plastic surgery for cosmetic purposes?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2016/03/to-the-point/what-is-the-churchs-view-on-plastic-surgery-for-cosmetic-purposes?lang=eng), New Era, 2016 March

&nbsp;

#### Word of Wisdom miscellany
> *There are other harmful substances and practices that are ==not specified in the Word of Wisdom or by Church leaders==. Members should use wisdom and prayerful judgment in making choices to promote their physical, spiritual, and emotional health.*

— [Word of Wisdom and Healthy Practices](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&id=p2380#p2380), General Handbook &sect; 38.7.14

&nbsp;

#### Vaccination
> *Ultimately, individuals are responsible to make their own decisions about vaccination. If members have concerns, they should counsel with competent medical professionals and also seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost.*

— [Vaccinations](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&id=p2468#p2468) General Handbook &sect; 38.7.13

&nbsp;

### Scripture
#### Book of Mormon Geography
> *Although Church members continue to discuss such theories today, the Church’s only position is that the events the Book of Mormon describes took place in the ancient Americas.*

— [Book of Mormon geography](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/book-of-mormon-geography?lang=eng), Topics and Questions

"This is our foundational book of scripture that we interpret as a literal history! We also refuse to talk about where it took place. Somewhere on this continent. Hope that helps."

&nbsp;

#### What "many mansions" means
> *The Church does not and has never purported to fully understand the specifics of Christ’s statement that “in my Father’s house are many mansions” (John 14:2).*

— [Frequently Asked Questions](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/frequently-asked-questions), Church Newsroom

&nbsp;

##### Oaks
> *A loving Heavenly Father has a better plan for His children. The revealed doctrine of the restored Church of Jesus Christ teaches that* all the children of God *—with exceptions too limited to consider here—will finally wind up in a kingdom of* glory. *In “In my Father’s house are many mansions,” Jesus taught. ==From modern revelation we know that those mansions are in three different kingdoms of glory==. In the Final Judgment each of us will be judged according to our deeds and the desires of our hearts. Before that, we will need to suffer for our unrepented sins. ==The scriptures are clear on that==. Then our righteous Judge will grant us residence in one of those kingdoms of glory. ==Thus, as we know from modern revelation==, all “shall be judged … , and every man shall receive according to his own works, his own dominion, in the mansions which are prepared.”*

— [Divine Love in the Father’s Plan](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/51oaks?lang=ase&id=p4#p4), President Dallin H. Oaks, First Counselor in the First Presidency, General Conference 2022 April

&nbsp;

### Polygamy in Heaven
**Is marriage in heaven polygamous?**

> *Moreover, members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married. ==The precise nature of these relationships in the next life is not known==, and many family relationships will be sorted out in the life to come. Latter-day Saints are encouraged to trust in our wise Heavenly Father, who loves His children and does all things for their growth and salvation.*

I, uh... I'm not [[Polygamy#Required for exaltation!|sure that is true]].

### Birth Control
> *Decisions about birth control and the consequences of those decisions rest solely with each married couple.*

&nbsp;

### Capital Punishment
> *We neither promote nor oppose capital punishment.*

— [Capital Punishment in Utah](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/capital-punishment-in-utah)

&nbsp;

## FAIR
One could argue that *Faithful Answers & Informed Responses* (FAIR) isn't *officially* part of the LDS church. On paper, they would be correct.

&nbsp;

### Hill Cumorah
> *Despite the claims of some, it is not the case that the Church authoritatively identifies the drumlin in western New York as the same Hill Cumorah mentioned in the text of the Book of Mormon. The Church has made it abundantly clear that it ==does not endorse any particular view of Book of Mormon geography==.*
> 
> *==The Church has no official position on any New World location described in the Book of Mormon==. There is no official revelation in the Church establishing the drumlin in New York as the Hill Cumorah of the Book of Mormon where two nations were destroyed.*

&nbsp;

### Continental Division during Noah's Flood
> *Some Latter-day Saint thinkers have understood the matter as referring to the sudden separation of the continents in a catastrophic event. Others have regarded this as a misunderstanding of the text*
> 
> *The Church has no official position, and it does not play much of a role in LDS thought or discourse.*

[Doesn't the Bible say that the continents were divided immediately after the Flood?](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/The_Flood#Doesn.27t_the_Bible_say_that_the_continents_were_divided_immediately_after_the_Flood.3F), The Flood, FAIR

&nbsp;

### Mary's Virginity
**Latter-day Saints believe in the virgin birth**

> *Often used as evidence are a handful statements from early LDS leaders, such as Brigham Young, that directly or indirectly support this idea. However, ==such statements do not represent the official doctrine of the Church==. The key, official doctrine of the Church is that Jesus is literally the son of God (i.e., this is not a symbolic or figurative expression), and Mary was a virgin before and after Christ's conception.* 

&nbsp;

**Latter-day Saints believe Jesus was the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh**

> *Latter-day Saints do believe that Jesus Christ was literally the Son of God, not the son of Joseph or even the son of the Holy Ghost. (see [2 Ne 25꞉12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) and [D&C 93꞉11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p11#p11)) As Ezra Taft Benson [stated](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2001/12/five-marks-of-the-divinity-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=p6#p6),*
>
>> *"Thus the testimonies of appointed witnesses leave no question as to the paternity of Jesus Christ. God was the Father of His fleshly tabernacle, and Mary, a mortal woman, was His mother. He is therefore the only person born who rightfully deserves the title “the Only Begotten Son of God.”"*
>
> **The Church does not take an official position on this issue.**

[Do Latter-day Saints believe that Mary was still a virgin when Jesus was born?](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:_Do_Mormons_believe_that_Mary_was_still_a_virgin_when_Jesus_was_born%3F), FAIR

"Let's see, we have... a translated ancient scripture, a modern scripture (both are in the canonized Standard Works, no less), and a modern-day prophet explaining it. It's settled, then— we've got *no official position* on this one!"

&nbsp;

### Progression in Kingdoms of Glory
**Do Mormons believe that there is there progression between the three degrees of glory?**

> *There is no official pronouncement on this question. Some leaders of the Church have, however, expressed deep skepticism about this idea.*

— [Do Mormons believe that there is there progression between the three degrees of glory?](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Question:_Do_Mormons_believe_that_there_is_there_progression_between_the_three_degrees_of_glory%3F), FAIR

FAIR then goes on to cite apostles, scriptures, and prophets who spoke definitively about this very topic, concluding the listing with:

> **The Church does not take an official position on this issue.**

I genuinely do not understand how they can quote *six church leaders* and *three scripture passages*, and conclude that there's no official position.

&nbsp;

### Was Jesus married?
> *The easy answer is that no, Mormons don't officially believe that Jesus was married. In fact, there is no official Church doctrine on this issue. Individual members are free to believe as they wish concerning this matter. (Some believe that He was married; others believe He wasn't. Most members are open to believe either way.)*

&nbsp; [Mormons don't officially believe that Jesus was married](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Facts_Mormons_Won%27t_Tell_You_When_They_Call_at_Your_Door#Mormons_don.27t_officially_believe_that_Jesus_was_married), FAIR

"Hah, that's an easy one—*no*. Also there's no definitive answer, so some folks think that the answer is 'yes.'"

&nbsp;

### Adam & the Garden of Eden
**If the Garden of Eden was in Missouri, how did Abraham, Moses and other prophets end up in the Old World?**

> *The solution chosen by an individual member will probably depend mostly on their attitudes to other issues about which there is ==no official Church position== and a variety of positions espoused by members.*

— [Mormonism and doctrine/Adam](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Mormonism_and_doctrine/Adam#Question:_If_the_Garden_of_Eden_was_in_Missouri.2C_how_did_Abraham.2C_Moses_and_other_prophets_end_up_in_the_Old_World.3F), FAIR

&nbsp;

**Was there no death on the entire earth before the Fall?**

> **The Church does not take an official position on this issue.**

— [Death before the Fall of Adam and Eve](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Death_before_the_Fall_of_Adam_and_EveWas_there_no_death_on_the_entire_earth_before_the_Fall.3F), FAIR
