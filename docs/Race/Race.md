# 🏁 Race
For 126 years, between [[Brigham Young|Brigham Young]]’s presidency beginning and 1978, imagine thousands of black Mormons praying to God to please lift the temple/priesthood ban… Then imagine [David O’McKay praying about it](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) and concluding, “Nah. We’re good for now.”

The LDS church has had some really odd takes on race in the past, and today likes to pretend that none of it ever happened. I'll be aggregating some quotes, teachings, and adding my own comments and thoughts to them. I will note that I am a white American, arguably the least qualified demographic to offer meaningful commentary on racial prejudice as none of this has ever [impacted me directly](https://youtu.be/RovF1zsDoeM&t=54). Also, ==please note that I'll be using direct quotes== from LDS church figureheads in the 19th and 20th centuries who use terms that we today consider to be offensive slurs. You know, figureheads like prophets and apostles who represent an eternally loving, unchanging father figure to all of mankind.

&nbsp;

A church that claims to be [[Restoration|restored]] by God should be ahead of the ‘[[Book of Mormon#Natural Man|natural man]]’ in getting things right, not behind. They took away the right of black members to enter the Celestial Kingdom, which is a spiritual issue, not a civil issue. The church likes to simply call it a priesthood ban, but let's not overlook that priesthood is a prerequisite for salvation. Folks were banned from salvation because of their race. I'll expound more on that later.

&nbsp;

Lots of my commentary revolves around the [Gospel Topics Essay](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng) on Race. Those notes became long enough to warrant being put in [[Essay Race Priesthood|their own dedicated page]].

## Pre-1978
### 1949 First Presidency Statement
> *August 17, 1949*  
>   
> *The attitude of the Church with reference to Negroes remains as it has always stood. ==It is not a matter of the declaration of a policy but of direct commandment from the Lord==, on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that Negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: "Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the holy priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we now are entitled to."*  
>   
> *President Wilford Woodruff made the following statement: "The day will come when all that race will be redeemed and possess all the blessings which we now have."*  
>   
> *The position of the Church regarding the Negro may be understood when another doctrine of the Church is kept in mind, namely, that ==the conduct of spirits in the premortal existence has some determining effect upon the conditions and circumstances under which these spirits take on mortality== and that while the details of this principle have not been made known, the mortality is a privilege that is given to those who maintain their first estate; and that the worth of the privilege is so great that spirits are willing to come to earth and take on bodies no matter what the handicap may be as to the kind of bodies they are to secure; and that among the handicaps, failure of the right to enjoy in mortality the blessings of the priesthood is a handicap which spirits are willing to assume in order that they might come to earth. Under this principle there is no injustice whatsoever involved in this deprivation as to the holding of the priesthood by the Negroes.*

I've looked for a primary source for this, and the best I can find is "it's [not available for research](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/aug-2020-church-historian-communication-on-1949-first-presidency-statement/)."

For this document to marked as "unavailable for research" sounds to me like it implies "it exists; we know the document you're talking about, but we won't give it to you." Sounds to me like the statement is "this is doctrine, not policy," and "they deserve it anyway."

&nbsp;

### Mark E Petersen
This guy has numerous things to say about race. I'll put just one quote here, but I assure you that plenty more exist. I've got some additional excerpts [[Various Quotes#Mark E. Petersen|on another page]].

> *I would be willing that they have all the advantages they can get out of life in the world. but let them enjoy these things among themselves. I ==think the Lord segregated the Negro and who is man to change that segregation==? It reminds me of the scripture on marriage, “what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” Only here we have the reverse of the thing—what God hath separated, let not man bring together again.*

— *[Race Problems - As They Affect the Church](https://www.fairlatterdaysaints.org/answers/Primary_sources/Mark_E._Petersen/Race_Problems_-_As_They_Affect_the_Church)*, Mark E. Petersen, August 27, 1954 at the BYU Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level

&nbsp;

### Spencer W Kimball
> *I am not sure that there will be a change, although there could be. We are under the dictates of our Heavenly Father, and ==this is not my policy or the Church’s policy. It is the policy of the Lord who has established it==, and I know of no change, although we are subject to revelations of the Lord in case he should ever wish to make a change.*

&nbsp;

## 1978 - 1999
### Bruce R. McConkie
My boy Bruce has plenty to say on plenty of topics. He has some quotes on race both before and after the revelation, which I have copied [[Various Quotes#McConkie|on another page]] for the sake of organizing by speaker rather than by time. I'd summarize the two statements as: "we are justified in these awful, racist teachings given to us from prophets of old," and "never mind, God is not racist anymore, and so we aren't either&mdash;but *you're* the one who needs to repent now."

&nbsp;

### LeGrand Richards
> *5 weeks after the initial announcement, two men were granted an opportunity to speak with LeGrand Richards, one of the senior Apostles. They asked several key questions of the Elder and one of the most straightforward descriptions of the process of modern revelation was given in reply. In addition, other interesting topics were discussed including the existence of Joseph’s seer-stone, the legitimacy of the “Lectures on Faith” and changes to the Book of Mormon.*

— *[The Legrand Richards Interview](https://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/the-legrand-richards-interview)*, Thoughts on Things and Stuff

The link above has a transcription of this interview, along with links to [an audio recording](https://archive.org/details/1978LegrandRichardsInterview) and [an offsite transcript](https://archive.org/details/CorrespondenceWithLeGrandRichardsRegarding1978Interview). I'll include two excerpts of that interview here:

> **WALTERS**: *On this revelation, of the priesthood to the Negro, I’ve heard all kinds of stories: I’ve heard that Christ appeared to the Apostles. I’ve heard that Joseph Smith appeared; and then I heard another story that Spencer Kimball had had a concern about this for some time and simply shared it with the apostles, and they decided that this was the right time to move in that direction. Now are any of those stories true, or are they all…*
> 
> **RICHARDS**: *Well, the last one is pretty true, and ==I might tell you what provoked it== in a way. Down in Brazil, there is so much Negro blood in the population there that it’s hard to get leaders that don’t have Negro blood in them. ==We just built a temple down there. It’s going to be dedicated in October. All those people with Negro blood in them have been raising the money to build that temple. And then, if we don’t change, then they can’t even use it==. So Brother Kimball worried about it, and he prayed a lot about it.*
> 
> *He asked each one of us of the Twelve if we would pray – and we did – that the Lord would give him the inspiration to know what the will of the Lord was. And then he invited each one of us in his office – individually, because you know when you are in a group, you can’t always express everything that’s in your heart. You’re part of the group, you see – so he interviewed each one of us, personally, to see how we felt about it, and he asked us to pray about it. And then he asked each one of us to hand in all the references we had, for, or against that proposal. See, he was thinking favorably toward giving the colored people the priesthood.*
> 
> *Then we had a meeting where we meet every week in the temple, and we discussed it as a group together, and then we prayed about it in our prayer circle, and then we held another prayer circle after the close of that meeting, and he (President Kimball) lead in the prayer; praying that the Lord would give us the inspiration that we needed to do the thing that would be pleasing to Him and for the blessing of His children. And then the next Thursday – we meet every Thursday – the Presidency came with this little document written out to make the announcement – to see how we’d feel about it – and present it in written form. Well, some of the members of the Twelve suggested a few changes in the announcement, and then in our meeting there we all voted in favor of it – the Twelve and the Presidency. One member of the Twelve, Mark Petersen, was down in South America, but Brother Benson, our President, had arranged to know where he could be reached by phone, and right while we were in that meeting in the temple, Brother Kimball talked with Brother Petersen, and read him this article, and he (Petersen) approved of it.*

> **VLACHOS:** *What about intermarriage? Is it okay?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *what?*
> 
> **VLACHOS:** *Is it okay to marry?*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *Intermarriage, is that in view too?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *Well, no. Never before this decision was reached we’ve always recommended that people live within their own race – the Japanese ought to marry Japanese, the Chinese ought to marry Chinese, Hawaiians ought to marry Hawaiians and the colored people ought to marry colored.*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *And that would still be your position?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *That is still our position. But they are entitled to the temple blessings and the sealing of their wives to them. It’s all conditioned on their living. Now if they live right and they’re devoted and they’re good clean living – why shouldn’t they get the blessings?*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *Now when President Kimball read this little announcement or paper, was that the same thing that was released to the press?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *Yeah.*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *There wasn’t a special document as a “revelation”, that he had and wrote down?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *We discussed it in our meeting. What else should we say besides that announcement? And we decided that was sufficient; that no more needed to be said.*
> 
> **WALTERS:** *Was that the letter you sent out to the various wards?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *And to the Church; and to the newspapers, yes.*
> 
> **VLACHOS:** *Will that become a part of “scripture”?*
> 
> **RICHARDS:** *Yes, I’ve already thought in my own mind of suggesting we add it to the Pearl of Great Price, just like those last two revelations that we’ve just added.*

Sounds to me like this "revelation" is in response to a business problem. They built a temple, but locals wouldn't be able to use it after paying for its construction, and that was "what provoked it."

&nbsp;

## 2000 & Later
### NAACP
> *Elder Stevenson began his remarks saying he was “deeply saddened and hurt” by an error included in a ==recent Church manual== referencing ==outdated commentary== about race.*
> 
> *“Our position as a Church is clear. We do condemn all racism, past or present, in any form, and we disavow any ==theory== that black or dark skin is a sign of a curse. We are brothers and sisters, and I consider you friends.”*

— *[“All Are Alike unto God,” Elder Stevenson Says at NAACP Luncheon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/all-are-alike-unto-god-elder-stevenson-says-at-naacp-luncheon?lang=eng)*, Church News, 22 January 2020

Alright, sure, cool, you can disavow theories, but *[[Race in scripture|scripture]] is not theory.* Until you disavow that *doctrine*, your words mean shit to me.

&nbsp;

"We're sad that we published something offensive and inaccurate."

"Did you retract those erroneous statements?"

"What statements?"

&nbsp;

### Ensign
> *Unfortunately, racism—the abhorrent and morally destructive ==theory== that claims superiority of one person over another by reason of race, color, ethnicity, or cultural background—remains one of the abiding sins of societies the world over. The cause of much of the strife and conflict in the world, racism is an offense against God and a tool in the devil’s hands. In common with other Christians, ==members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints regret the actions and statements of individuals who have been insensitive to the pain suffered by the victims of racism and ask God’s forgiveness for those guilty of this grievous sin==. The sin of racism will be eliminated only when every human being treats all others with the dignity and respect each deserves as a beloved child of our Heavenly Father.*
> 
> *How grateful I am that ==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has from its beginnings stood strongly against racism in any of its malignant manifestations==. President Spencer W. Kimball stated the Church’s position well: “We do wish that there would be no racial prejudice. … Racial prejudice is of the devil. … There is no place for it in the gospel of Jesus Christ” (The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, ed. Edward L. Kimball [1982], 236–37).*

— [“No More Strangers”](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2000/09/no-more-strangers?lang=eng&id=p5-p6#p5), By Elder Alexander B. Morrison Of the Seventy, Ensign September 2000

Boy, those church leaders sure like calling racism a theory.

"We've *never* been racist."

&nbsp;

### General Conference
> *Racial strife still lifts its ugly head. I am advised that even right here among us there is some of this. I cannot understand how it can be. It seemed to me that ==we all rejoiced in the 1978 revelation given President Kimball==. I was there in the temple at the time that that happened. There was no doubt in my mind or in the minds of my associates that what was revealed was the mind and the will of the Lord.*
> 
> *Now I am told that racial slurs and denigrating remarks are sometimes heard among us. I remind you that ==no man who makes disparaging remarks concerning those of another race can consider himself a true disciple of Christ==. Nor can he consider himself to be in harmony with the teachings of the Church of Christ. How can any man holding the Melchizedek Priesthood arrogantly assume that he is eligible for the priesthood whereas another who lives a righteous life but whose skin is of a different color is ineligible?*

— [The Need for Greater Kindness](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/04/the-need-for-greater-kindness?lang=eng&id=p7-p8#p7), President Gordon B. Hinckley, President of the Church, General Conference April 2006

So... if the prophet of God in 2006 can make this declaration, can it be retrofitted to those, say, prior to 1978? Because if so, this presents something of a conundrum. And if not, can we call the prophet authoritative?

&nbsp;

### Leadership Charts
Take a brief once-over of this chart depicting *General Authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints* in the mid-2010's:

- 2013
	- [LDS365](https://lds365.com/2013/10/29/general-authorities-chart-october-2013/) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240722011555/https://lds365.com/2013/10/29/general-authorities-chart-october-2013/))
	- [Ensign](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2013/11/general-authorities-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng)
	- [Church Newsroom](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/chart-of-general-authorities-available-for-download?lang=eng)
- 2014
	- [LDS365](https://lds365.com/2014/05/01/general-authority-chart-april-2014/)   ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240722022251/https://lds365.com/2014/05/01/general-authority-chart-april-2014/))
	- [Ensign](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2014/11/general-authorities-and-general-officers-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng)
	- [LDS CDN](https://media.ldscdn.org/pdf/magazines/ensign-may-2014/2014-05-42-general-authorities-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-eng.pdf) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240805202602/https://media.ldscdn.org/pdf/magazines/ensign-may-2014/2014-05-42-general-authorities-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-eng.pdf))

The linked years don't have symmetrical content to compare. Maybe you can find the Newsroom & CDN links? I couldn't.

These visualizations of the church's top leadership are noteworthy in this context of race because... glancing over all those faces, and count how many non-white leaders there are? I saw one black fellow in 2013, and two in 2014. This, to me, is an effect of the priesthood ban being in effect 35 years prior. Yes, black folks can now hold leadership roles, but has it really taken 35+ years for them to rank high enough to be counted among those in the church's top leadership? Don't worry though, they solved racism already. It's just that God still happens to favor successful white lawyers from Salt Lake county.
