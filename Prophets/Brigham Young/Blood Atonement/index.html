<p><em>The phrase is used in everyday speech to indicate doubt of someone's sincerity, and especially that someone who denies something very strongly is hiding the truth.</em></p>

<p>I'm not pretentious enough to claim that I know more than a handful of Shakespearean lines, but this one fits pretty well. The modern LDS church so vehemently rejects anything to do with this, leading to what I would call a case of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Streisand-effect">Streisand Effect</a>.

<p><em>The doctrines of the Church affirm that the Atonement wrought by the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is efficacious for the sins of all who believe, repent, are baptized by one having authority, and receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. However, if a person thereafter commits a grievous sin such as the shedding of innocent blood, <mark>the Savior's sacrifice alone will not absolve the person of the consequences of the sin</mark>. Only by voluntarily submitting to whatever penalty the Lord may require can that person benefit from the atonement of Christ.</em> </p>
<p><em>Several early Church leaders, most notably Brigham Young, taught that in a complete theocracy the Lord could require the voluntary shedding of a murderer's blood— presumably by capital punishment— as part of the process of atonement for such grievous sin. This was referred to as "blood atonement." Since such a theocracy has not been operative in modern times, the practical effect of the idea was <mark>its use as a rhetorical device</mark> to heighten the awareness of Latter-day Saints of the seriousness of murder and other major sins. <mark>This view is not a doctrine of the Church and has never been practiced by the Church at any time</mark>.</em></p>
<p><em>Early anti-Mormon writers charged that under Brigham Young the Church practiced "blood atonement," by which they meant Church-instigated violence directed at dissenters, enemies, and strangers. This claim distorted the whole idea of blood atonement— which was based on <mark>voluntary submission by an offender</mark>— into a supposed justification of involuntary punishment. Occasional isolated acts of violence that occurred in areas where Latter-day Saints lived were <mark>typical of that period in the history</mark> of the American West, but they were not instances of Church-sanctioned blood atonement.</em></p>

<p><em>From the days of Joseph Smith to the present, <mark>wicked and evilly-disposed persons have fabricated false and slanderous stories</mark> to the effect that the Church, in the early days of this dispensation, engaged in a practice of blood atonement whereunder the blood of apostates and others was shed by the Church as an atonement for their sins. <mark>These claims are false and were known by their originators to be false</mark>. There is not one historical instance of so-called blood atonement in this dispensation, nor has there been one event or occurrence whatever, of any nature, from which <mark>the slightest inference arises that any such practice either existed or was taught</mark>.</em></p>
<p><em>. . .</em></p>
<p><em>But under certain circumstances <mark>there are some serious sins for which the cleansing of Christ does not operate</mark>, and the law of God is that <mark>men must then have their own blood shed to atone for their sins</mark>. Murder, for instance, is one of these sins; hence we find the Lord commanding capital punishment. Thus, also, if a person has so progressed in righteousness that his <mark>calling and election has been made sure</mark>, if he has come to that position where he knows "by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood" that he is sealed up unto eternal life (D. &amp; C. 131:5), then if he gains forgiveness for certain grievous sins, he must "be destroyed in the flesh," and "delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God." (D. &amp; C. 132:19-27.)</em></p>
<p><em>President Joseph Fielding Smith has written: "Man may commit certain grievous sins - according to his light and knowledge - that will place him <mark>beyond the reach of the atoning blood of Christ</mark>. If then he would be saved, <mark>he must make sacrifice of his Own life to atone</mark> - so far as in his power lies - for that sin, for the blood of Christ alone under certain circumstances will not avail. . . . Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will <mark>place the transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ</mark>. If these offenses are committed, then <mark>the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone</mark>, as far as possible, in their behalf" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 133-138.) This doctrine can only be practiced in its fulness in a day when the civil and ecclesiastical laws are administered in the same hands. . . .</em></p>

<p><em>See, for example, Brigham Young, in Journal of Discourses, 4:53–54; and Heber C. Kimball, in Journal of Discourses, 7:16–21. This concept, which came to be known as blood atonement, was a stock component of anti-Mormon rhetoric in the 19th century. While many of the <mark>exaggerated claims</mark> that appeared in the popular press and anti-Mormon literature are <mark>easily disproven</mark>, it is <mark>likely</mark> that <mark>in at least one instance</mark>, a <mark>few Latter-day Saints acted</mark> on this <mark>rhetoric</mark>. Nevertheless, most Latter-day Saints seem to have recognized that the blood atonement sermons were, in the words of historian Paul Peterson, “<mark>hyperbole</mark> or incendiary talk” that were “likely designed to frighten church members into conforming with Latter-day Saint principles. To Saints with good intentions, they were calculated to cause alarm, introspection, and ultimately repentance. For those who refused to comply with Mormon standards, it was hoped such ominous threats would hasten their departure from the Territory.”</em></p>

<p>Easily disproven? Can you point me to a disproving claim, then?</p>
<p>"It's likely that in least one instance, at least one member at some point time in history maybe did this." I don't know that I could fit more qualifiers in that sentence if I tried to. That's genuinely impressive.</p>

<p><em>But if the Government of God on earth, and Eternal Priesthood, with the sanction of High Heaven, in the midst of all his people, has passed sentence on certain sins when they appear in a person, has not the people of God a right to carry out that part of his law as well as any other portion of it? <mark>It is their right to baptize a sinner to save him, and it is also their right to kill a sinner to save him, when he commits those crimes that can only be atoned for by shedding his blood</mark>.

We have those amongst us that are full of all manner of abominations, <mark>those who need to have their bloodshed</mark>, for water will not do, <mark>their sins are too deep a dye</mark>… I believe that there are a great many; and if they are covenant breakers we need a place designated, where we can shed their blood … Brethren and sisters, we want you to repent and forsake your sins. And you who have committed <mark>sins that cannot be forgiven through baptism, let your blood be shed</mark>, and let the smoke ascend, that the incense thereof may come up before God as an atonement for your sins, and that the sinners in Zion may be afraid.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Prostitution</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is believed in the world that our females are all common women. Well, in one sense they are common—that is, they are like all other women, I suppose; but they are not unclean, for <mark>we wipe all unclean ones from our midst</mark>: we not only wipe them from our streets, but <mark>we wipe them out of existence</mark>. And if the world want to practice uncleanness, and bring their prostitutes here, if they do not repent and forsake such sins, <mark>we will wipe the evil out</mark>. We will not have them in this valley, unless they repent; for, so help me God, while I live, <mark>I will lend my hand to wipe such persons out; and I know this people will</mark>.</em></p>
<p><em>Such things cannot exist here. . . . It never can be allowed in this community in male or female, whether they belong to the Church or not; and <mark>we will wipe out such abominations</mark>, the Lord being our helper.</em></p>
<p><em><mark>That is sanctification</mark>. Our holy religion is to purify, purge, cleanse, and sanctify this people. We care not what people think or say about our course in this respect; it is our religion, and <mark>we will not have corruption where we dwell</mark>, if we can help it. That is one reason we were not permitted to live in the States: we were determined, by the help of God, to be virtuous men and women.</em></p>
<p><em>. . .</em></p>
<p><em>These are my views, and the Lord knows that I believe in the principles of sanctification; and when I am guilty of seducing any man's wife, or any woman in God's world, <mark>I say, sever my head from my body</mark>.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wipe out" is a lot less explicit than "I'm about to give you some height-reduction surgery". However, threatening to wipe out evil abominations from existence doesn't seem so veiled. I don't feel like that's got much plausible deniability.</p>

<p><em>Are you aware that <mark>there are certain sins that man may commit for which the atoning blood of Christ does not avail</mark>? Do you not know, too, that <mark>this doctrine is taught in the Book of Mormon</mark>? And is not this further reason why you should discard the book as well as the name? Is it not safe for us to rely upon the scriptures for the solution of problems of this kind?</em></p>
<p><em>. . .</em></p>
<p><em>But <mark>man may commit certain grievous sins</mark> — according to his light and knowledge — <mark>that will place him beyond the reach of the atoning blood of Christ</mark>. If then he would be saved he must make sacrifice of his own life to atone — so far as in his power lies — <mark>for that sin, for the blood of Christ alone under certain circumstances will not avail</mark>.</em></p>
<p><em>MURDERERS AND THE ATONEMENT. Do you believe this doctrine? If not, then I do say you do not believe in the true doctrine of the atonement of Christ. This is the doctrine you are pleased to call the "blood atonement of Brighamism." <mark>This is the doctrine of Christ our Redeemer</mark>, who died for us. <mark>This is the doctrine of Joseph Smith</mark>, and I accept it.</em></p>
<p><em>. . .</em></p>
<p><em>ATONEMENT AND SINS UNTO DEATH. Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will place the transgressors <mark>beyond the power of the atonement of Christ</mark>. If these offenses are committed, then <mark>the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins</mark> even though they repent. Therefore <mark>their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone</mark>, as far as possible, in their behalf. <mark>This is scriptural doctrine</mark>, and is taught in all the standard works of the Church. The doctrine was established in the beginning. that “Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for man shall not shed the blood of man. For a commandment I give, that every man’s brother shall preserve the life of man, for in mine own image have I made man.”</em></p>
<p><em>. . .</em></p>
<p><em>CHURCH <mark>NEVER PRACTICED BLOOD ATONEMENT</mark>. Your report says: "This doctrine was introduced by Brigham Young" and that it meant "death to anyone who left the Church . . . that the apostate whose throat was cut from ear to ear . . . saved his soul." Why you made this statement you best know; but were you not aware that it was but the repetition of the ravings of enemies of the Church, <mark>without one grain of truth</mark>?</em></p>
<p><em>Did you not know that <mark>not a single individual was ever "blood atoned,"</mark> as you are pleased to call it, for apostasy or any other cause? Were you not aware, in repeating this false charge, that it was made by the most bitter enemies of the Church before the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith? Do you know of anyone whose blood was ever shed by the command of the Church, or members thereof, to "save his soul?" . . .</em></p>
<p><em><mark>Never in the history of this people can the time be pointed to</mark> when the Church ever attempted to pass judgment on, or execute an apostate as per your statement. There are men living in Utah today who left the Church in the earliest history of our State who feel as secure, and are just as secure and free from molestation from their former associates as you or any other man could be.</em></p>

<p>I intend to dig into those footnote references; he mentions numerous scripture passages, and at face value, I am very skeptical.</p>
<p>Not sure what conclusion we’re trying to reach here, honestly. The section appears to have various sub-headings, marked by all-caps short statements? It starts out acknowledging that Christ's atonement covers everything, but... maybe just <em>most</em> things. Then we focus on how this is an anomaly found only in the Brighamite sect of Mormonism, along with numerous scriptural backings. Next... "Yeah, if you goof up too bad, you've got to die." Then we make a hard left turn, a complete 180, asserting "this is all nonsense hearsay, 'without one grain of truth.' This never happened. You can't name anyone who actually got involved, can you? Mic drop."</p>
