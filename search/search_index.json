I was homeschooled, was raised to believe that the outside world is evil, scary, ruled by Satan. I shouldn't go to a proper school, the other students might influence me to do nonspecific bad things. I was raised to believe that only our scriptures &amp; church leaders can bring us happiness &amp; fulfilment. A lot of it made sense at the time.</p> <p>Occasionally I would hear some outrageous claims of Joseph Smith doing shady things, but clearly this was an attempt by the devil to pull me away from happiness.</p> <p>In my first year of early-morning seminary at age 14, studying the Doctrine &amp; Covenants and church history, I clearly remember hearing numerous accounts of disaffected members leaving the faith over petty reasons; minimizing their experience, diminishing it to \"being offended\" over something trivial. After all, who in their right might would walk away from this?</p> <p>Doing baptisms for the dead as a teenager was always hyped up as a life-changing event. We did it twice a year, if memory serves right. I do recall treating it as a virtue-signaling opportunity to show how dignified and spiritual I could be to the girls there. I also recall how calm, ritualistic, solemn the process was. I remember temple workers corralling us down specific hallways, blocking specific doors, and wordlessly herding the group of teenagers toward the baptismal font. \"One day,\" I thought, \"I\u2019ll see what else these buildings contain. Adults seem very hush-hush about it. Must be cool?\"</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"My%20own%20experience/#temple-prep","title":"Temple Prep","text":"<p>It comes to a head when I\u2019m preparing to serve a mission. Taking part in the Temple Prep class was a big red flag. For around six weeks during the third hour, and each lesson was \"well, it\u2019s very symbolic, and is very sacred.\" Each week the instructor would say, in so many words, that this is very sacred and we can\u2019t talk about it outside the temple. One needs to be in tune with the spirit to receive this information properly.</p> <p>I\u2019d come \"prepared\" by meditating, pondering, and praying. Same message every week. It's too sacred to talk about here. My skepticism grew each successive week\u2014why am I going to this class if it's just a nothing-burger?</p> <p>The night before going to the temple for my own endowment ceremony, my dad tried to soften the upcoming blow by describing the ceremony: Anti-Mormons will say that the ceremony consisting of a lot of passwords and secret handshakes. In reality\u2026 it consists of a lot of passwords and secret handshakes. But it\u2019s not weird, there are attendants who will help you through them! I guess that\u2019s the part that my temple prep class kept skirting around.</p> <p>Once I get into the endowment ceremony for my first time in late 2012, I remember my heart racing, as the whole group wordlessly mimics the officiator in swearing away their time, possessions and money. I remember feeling very anxious and uncomfortable, as I had zero knowledge of what was coming, and this was absolutely nothing like any other LDS ceremony I had known of. This felt like a damned cult. I remember the moment where the group is prompted that \"if any of you wish to withdraw from making these eternally binding consequences, before God, angels, and these witnesses, make it known now by raising your hand!\" The entire congregation turned and stared at me. Was I going to flake out now? Now that I already have a date to enter the MTC? No, I have faith, and I\u2019ll make this work! Somehow\u2026</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"My%20own%20experience/#mission","title":"Mission","text":"<p>I grew up insulated from much of the world, in various parts of the midwest, and northern Texas. My mission call sent me to Los Angeles. I distinctly remember descending through the clouds to the LAX airport, and feeling a moderate panic attack at how urbanized and dense the view was. Seeing scarce green space, and reminding myself that I, an anxious dork from Kansas, will be held accountable for spreading Jesus' gospel to all eight million of these people. Being immersed in the massive city of LA where seeing green grass was a rarity kept my stress levels above healthy intervals, to put it lightly. My response to the ordeal was to double down, insist that I represent Jesus Christ and that I cannot be wrong\u2014 I cannot and will not falter and give up now. This work is important.</p> <p>As a district leader, I had another companionship call to vent that they \"had their testimonies attacked\" by some embittered ex-members. Claims about tithing, financial transparency, polygamy, hidden information, etc.. I assured them that, if they felt shaken, they can take the evening off to regain composure in their apartment, study and pray. I\u2019d check in with them the next day. They shrugged it off and we never spoke of it again. Today, I think back on those days surrounding that event, and wonder what could have happened if I pushed a bit harder.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"My%20own%20experience/#university","title":"University","text":"<p>One could rightly argue that the point of post-secondary education is not to train a student to perform a task, but to teach them critical thinking to adapt to a wide range of tasks. Who could have foreseen that critical thinking would conflict with my religious beliefs? Moreover, who would have guessed that studying databasing and statistics would bring it all crashing down? I took no classes in philosophy or anthropology.</p> <p>Part of my studies required loose financial literacy, so I took two accounting classes. No struggle there, as they were entry-level courses. Seeing the high-level overview of how money is tracked, managed, allocated and expended was satisfying. The meticulous records to balance assets &amp; liabilities was intriguing, but moreso was the assurance that every organization handling money should be following these generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP).</p> <p>Another key component was statistics. Specifically, how critical thinking applies to \"studies\" and reports. One qualitative concept that got regularly emphasized was \"who benefits from this information?\" \"who is funding this study?\" Amid all the math formulas were critical thinking approaches, to detect and analyze motivated reasoning. When information is presented, consider what incentive the presenter has.</p> <p>The approximately 40-minute drive between my home and my university was a nice opportunity to listen to podcasts or music. Other days, it's a nice time for quiet reflection, as the drive had very few turns once I reached the thoroughfare. I do recall one day pondering how blessed I felt to be in this position. I was in my late 20's, with my own private car, enjoying some air conditioning, driving independently to a post-secondary education. By the media console in the car was a smartphone, able to stream media remotely, then use Bluetooth to play the content over the stereo in my car. In my last few semesters, I needed to decide between a course in digital forensics or web application security. That decision is what weighed most heavily on my mind.</p> <p>At once, the thought occurs to me \"there are impoverished humans, children of God, who don't even have clean water.\" And here I was, with a steel double-insulated tumbler, keeping refreshing, icy water at a frigid temperature even in late July. What makes me so special, so fortunate? Why is there such an awful disparity between me, a middle-class white American man, and Syrian children who truly believed they would die of thirst before next week? There are humans with more money than they could hope to spend in their lifetime, and there are humans whose lives would be forever changed by a single cash injection of $50 USD, or even a durable pair of shoes.</p> <p>My local Sacrament Meetings had flowery messages about how God loves all of His children. The idea doesn't sit well with me. Does God just show that love in different ways based on what side of an imaginary border you're on? God seems to have lots of practice helping people find their lost car keys, but doesn't seem to be interested in ecclesiastical abuse. Does God bless those with prosperity only to the remarkably small proportion of humans who attend LDS meetings weekly? Does God not care about these disparities? Does he watch with indifference as humans suffer? Is God even there?</p> <p>My cognitive dissonance further compounded when I finally had a chance to meet other humans, outside the context of the LDS faith, outside of a mission call. Folks with dyed hair were living happy, fulfilled lives. Humans engaging in extramarital intercourse were not visibly doomed to a life of treating STI\u2019s and mononucleosis. Students were performing well without saying a prayer before an exam. Instructors taught without verbally qualifying their statements as being led by the spirit.</p> <p>So, then, what if some of those crazy anti-Mormons have a point? What if this faith isn\u2019t the only way to happiness? What kind of claims are they making?</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"My%20own%20experience/#connecting-the-dots","title":"Connecting the dots","text":"<p>Summer of 2018 is when the MormonLeaks wiki reported that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had some outrageous sum of money that is not being actively disbursed. I think I had seen it as a headline in our student newspaper, and found the possibility to be troubling. My time spent in accounting classes gave me the expectation that the church is surely keeping track of all this. Why would they not set the record straight? If they did not have the data, that would be a problem. If they did have the data but refuse to share, that would also be a problem. I'm no Certified Practicing Accountant (CPA), but I'd read enough ledgers and balance sheets to navigate my way around them.</p> <p>One long weekend, I resolved that I'd see this problem through to completion. I was going to find those financial records and demonstrate my entry-level comprehension of ledgers to settle the issue myself, and so I began searching through online resources\u2014armed with tech literacy, boolean operators, and a drive to defend God's true church from those loons who would dare to misinterpret a balance sheet.</p> <p>What I ended up discovering was that I'm hardly the first to seek out the church's documents. What I read instead were frustrated comments of \"these documents are nowhere to be found!\" Various bloggers and podcast hosts would either dismiss the opacity as a non-issue, or observe that the church is hiding something. No, they're not legally obligated to, and so they don't.</p> <p>Huh. That doesn't sit well with what I'd been taught by the church itself about accountability and responsibility. I ultimately gave up on that pursuit, having frequently seen mention of something called the CES Letter, a hiss and a byword among Mormons. I figured that was outside the scope of my pursuit, but after enough dead ends of finding nothing but rumors concerning the church's amassed wealth, I was running out of alternatives. This infamous document is presented as having some information on the matter... I rationalized that it was probably just biased complaints about some unfounded rumors, so I stayed away.</p> <p>Drawing from experience in analyzing statistics, if the church stands to benefit from one angle of its history, it will push that angle. It will insist that the faith-promoting story is the only story. The promotion of faith will lead members to pay tithes. On the flip side, who gets a financial interest in a version that does not promote faith? The anti-Mormons don\u2019t have a centralized agency that needs funding. Should I look at their side of the story?</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"My%20own%20experience/#getting-antid","title":"Getting \"Anti'd\"","text":"<p>For most of 2018, I\u2019d shied away from reading evil literature, inspired by the Devil, and had identified some the names of documents to avoid. How bad could they be, though? I\u2019m smart enough, and faithful enough to discern truth irrespective of the source.</p> <p>Searching for info on the church's benevolent, altruistic use of their tithing funds led me to discourse about the CES letter\u2014presented as either a pathetic attempt to tear down God\u2019s unstoppable work, or a logically infallible refutation of the LDS church\u2019s claims. Maybe there\u2019s some middle ground. What ultimately led me here was the pursuit of information concerning the LDS church's use of tithing money. When I delved in, the early chapters of the CES letter described the Book of Mormon, and some problematic parallels in its contents. I remember thinking up some explanations for these problems, most revolving around the idea that solid information doesn\u2019t exist to settle these questions. Whether or not a horse was a horse (of course) was inconsequential to Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Moving on, they\u2019re non-issues.</p> <p>Later chapters described Joseph Smith, particularly the First Vision, where he is called as a prophet by Jesus himself, accompanied by Elohim. This is where I first hear the idea that multiple accounts of the First Vision exist. \"Surely not, this isn\u2019t the kind of thing Joseph would be ambiguous about,\" I retorted to my inner monologue. \"They\u2019re misinformed! What source are they using to back up this claim?\" The link sent me to LDS.org, the church\u2019s official website, which corroborated the claim that the described First Vision that was compulsory to repeat verbatim in each mission Zone Conference, was not the first, but was in direct conflict with other accounts written by Joseph.</p> <p>Oh shit. The anti-Mormons are right about this.</p> <p>I flipped back to the earlier claims about the Book of Mormon anachronisms, checking each cited source for a claim. Shit. The LDS church has this in writing. Shit. Oh fuck.</p> <p>What if the evil people are right? The perfect church, led by men inspired of God himself\u2026 what if it was wrong? What if God wasn\u2019t leading it? Is this all a scam?</p> <p>I had to put my tablet down and stare off into the distance for some unknown amount of time. I distinctly remember the landscape in early-October, just as autumn foliage was becoming colorful. I don\u2019t know how much time passed. Today, I\u2019d estimate it to be twenty minutes, before reacting instinctively by clasping my hands together, kneeling, to supplicate some deity. I felt nothing. Silence.

Some sources more satisfying than others\u2014 I can say that, at the time, I didn\u2019t feel like the CES letter was bulletproof or undeniable. But it had enough compelling information that my \"shelf\" that had since collapsed was further crushed under the weight of more questions and discrepancies. Hoffman's salamander letters. Polygamy being so much worse and pervasive than I had been led to believe. Brigham Young\u2019s theocratic dictatorship. Book of Abraham.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom within Mormonism when confronted by some non-specific challenge is to attend the temple, listen to the prophets, read scriptures, etc. I wouldn't be able to answer the temple recommend questions pertaining to faith, belief, or sustaining church leaders, but figured that God knew my dilemma\u2014 I've got to get in there to rebuild my testimony. The most recent two or three times attending an endowment ceremony were sobering, reminiscent of the ominous silence I felt when praying. I couldn't get over how bizarre the ritual was, and how what I read in the Old Testament as doctrinal backing for it all felt tenuous at best. Not knowing much about Masonic ceremonies, I could buy into the idea that this was plagiarized. This didn't feel like it was from God.</p> <p>Maybe the most upcoming General Conference carried some messages of hope? October 2018 was when the president of the church, Russell-M-Nelson, felt that the most important thing for God's mouthpiece to relay to us was that \"Mormon\" is a bad word now.

It included some doctrinal instruction but also practical teaching, some of which is speculative in nature and some of which is only of historical interest.</p> <p>The content of the Journal of Discourses was transcribed, sometimes inaccurately, and published between 1854 and 1886 in England. The compilation contains some statements of doctrine as well as other materials of interest to Latter-day Saints who lived far from the center of the Church, including speeches given for a variety of occasions, funeral addresses, reports from returning missionaries, prayers, and the proceedings of a trial.</p> <p>So... Philosophies of men mingled with scripture?</p> <p> </p> <p>Questions have been raised about the accuracy of some transcriptions. Modern technology and processes were not available for verifying the accuracy of transcriptions, and some significant mistakes have been documented. The Journal of Discourses includes interesting and insightful teachings by early Church leaders; however, by itself it is not an authoritative source of Church doctrine.</p> <p>And yet church leaders sure do like to quote it to establish ethos. More on that after a short ramble.</p> <p>Please, point out the documented \"significant mistakes.\" Where are they? If it isn't authoritative \"by itself,\" what accompanying document makes it authoritative? Are they records of sustained prophets of God, or not? Do we have better documented sources of John Taylor's sermons?</p> <p> </p> <p>This is like saying we stand by the Bible, but only as far as it's translated correctly. Church leadership has had 200 years to sit on this conundrum, and has yet to delineate what parts of the bible are inaccurate, and which are solid translations to hang your hat on. Same issue here with the Journal of Discourses. You can't pick and choose parts of it, and say that Brigham Young's uncomfortable sermons were \"transcribed inaccurately\". Get the fuck out of here with that.</p> <p>But here we are, with the assurance that the Journal of Discourses exists and you could go find it if you wanted to. Some of it is legitimate, some of it is not, and there is no way for you to know which is which\u2014so the church has plausible deniability when something uncomfortable get quoted. I've found three or four sites online that have JoD published, but elected to reference Byu\u2019s scriptural library.

Extraordinarily helpful in softening the blows of existential dread. Former Mormon folks evaluating Christianity at large, sharing some goofiness and laughs along the way.</li> <li>Last Podcast on the Left: Mormonism: The show normally focuses on \"true crime,\" and examining historical shenanigans.

However, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty among religious scholars regarding what the authors meant when the word \u201cSatan\u201d appears in the Old Testament. The definition can vary depending on how the\u00a0Biblical\u00a0Hebrew term for Satan (\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c2\u05d8\u05b8\u05df\u200e\u200e) is translated and interpreted. In some cases, the term simply means \u201copponent\u201d or \u201cadversary\u201d and clearly indicates a human figure, not a supernatural one. In other cases, it suggests Satan is \u201cthe accuser,\u201d or part of a heavenly legal system. There is no consensus on which references to Satan indicate human adversaries and which ones indicate a supernatural enemy of God (source:\u00a0Stokes). While the concept took many forms over the centuries, the idea of Satan representing an outsider who opposes established values is the common thread woven through all his incarnations.</p> <p>The\u00a0Christian\u00a0New Testament contains a much clearer evolution of Satan as a single, supernatural evil being in opposition to God. He often appears at God\u2019s behest, to test humans so they display their true faith (source:\u00a0Farrar and Williams). This version of Satan is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Satan of the Scriptures.\u201d</p> <p>However, even in the New Testament there is a great deal of confusion about who Satan is. Scholars must look closely at different translations of the Hebrew and Aramaic words for \u201cevil one\u201d or the proper names of certain demons, like Abaddon, Beelzebub or Belial, and try to guess whether they refer to Satan or a more generic evil in context.

Kapp, Young Women General President, General Conference 1990 October</p> <p> </p> <p>The Satanic Panic is a moral panic spanning the 1970's through the late 90's, and I find it absolutely fascinating. I suppose that one reason for why this non-specific cultural anxiety so thoroughly grabbed my attention is that religious teachings, rhetorical or not, overflowed into real, tangible consequences for people who were only peripherally involved with Christianity's fear-mongering culture. Since I was raised in the United States, most of my cultural perception is within this country's borders\u2014 as such, I am less informed about this moral panic's effects outside of \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 'mericuh \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8</p> <p>Above is a link to Wikipedia's description of the Satanic Panic broadly, but the site also has an article specifically about this moral panic within the state of Utah\u2014 and we now have an intersection of two topics that I can't seem to get enough reading material about. </p> <p> </p> <p>By my estimation, this moral panic is an overreaction to teenage counter-culture. Little Suzie and Jimmy are exploring genres of music, and listening to Metallica elicits a reaction of tut-tutting disapproval from their overbearing religious parents. This gives the teenagers some level of influence and control, even catharsis against the restrictive rules imposed upon them. Cassette tapes that imply affinity for Christianity's boogeyman elicit yet a stronger reaction from scrutinizing, controlling religious parents. Drawing pentagrams and violently abusing the neighbor's dog is enough to draw anguished tears from the authority figures who teenagers were otherwise powerless against. Of course they're going to keep escalating.</p> <p>A seventeen-year-old doofus who understands the game Dungeons &amp; Dragons knows that it's a social storytelling activity. The use of dice adds entropy and parameterized unpredictability to the game's storytelling. Vanquishing the imaginary demon\u2014only as tangible and consequential as a piece of paper can be\u2014is a fantasy group activity. Two outcomes follow: building group cohesion with your pals, and causing your stoic, taciturn parents to panic. A win-win situation for an angsty, hormonal teenager. Of course he's going to lean into it.</p> <p>Pushing boundaries is part of growing up. Every adult you've ever seen or talked to was a teenager at one point, and they'll expect \"kids these days\" to adhere to some unspoken or unjustified higher standard. Lather, rinse, repeat until general authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints identify this as a theological crisis that must be publicly addressed. Here I've collected some of those materials\u2014targeted exclusively toward minors. After all, this is only pertinent to kids and teenagers... right?</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Christianity/Satanic-panic/#music","title":"Music","text":"<p>Maybe I'm still a product of my sheltered upbringing, but if you were to ask me to locate and identify some dance music that glorifies Satan-worship, I wouldn't even know where to look for it. The closest matches I could think of are just counter-culture \"up yours, mom &amp; dad\" teenage-angst songs. I don't know how prevalent this style of satirical music was in the 1970's, nor any \"legitimate\" Satanic music. I will describe below, in the context of one of the excerpts, that \"Satan-worship\" music is a category of its own, rather than \"I snort cocaine while engaging in sodomy\" qualifying as worshipful.</p> <p>Reading what LDS church authorities have to say, I might conclude that \"Satanic music\" is so ubiquitous that every other vinyl exclusively contained musical instructions to burn Bibles or something. You know, the real foot-tappin' tunes that the cool kids are into!</p> <p> </p> <p>How does one learn to select the best popular music? The answer to this question lies in what a song says, what a performance implies, and what kind of response is elicited. It\u2019s quite easy to evaluate the explicit message of a song by listening to the words. If moral misconduct, the use of drugs, Satan-worship, rejection of legal authority, or any act or attitude contrary to the gospel is advocated, the song should not be used. For example, Jesus Christ, Superstar was found to be unacceptable because its doctrine is incorrect.</p> <p>\u2014 Popular Music Guidelines, Ensign 1974 April</p> <p>The... The doctrine is incorrect? You're telling me that a rock opera shouldn't be equated with authorized, prophetic insight? ... Okay. Thanks for clarifying.

Those aspects in a song do not qualify the song as Satan-worship. They are not mutually exclusive, nor are they the criteria. \"Satan-worship\" songs are not songs about sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, etc. They are their own category.</p> <p>Added bonus: at the top of this article is the following \"Editors' Note (updated Feb. 2020):\"</p> <p>Articles in the magazines archive may reflect the terms and language of an earlier time.

Moroni 7:17 tells us that anything that persuades us to do evil (such as the songs referred to in the previous sections) is ultimately \u201cof the devil.\u201d But, unfortunately, several groups have progressed beyond merely trying to persuade us to do evil. By their own boasting, many have become heavily involved in the occult, in witchcraft, in black magic, and in Satan worship itself. Such groups use their music and their lyrics to spread this mysticism and demonology to their listening public.</p> <p>\u2014 A Closer Look at Popular Music, Ensign 1983 March</p> <p> </p> <p>\"These bands whose livelihood depends on counter-culture have said that they're engaged in both black magic and Satanism!

Tell me there isn't a teenager, only permitted to read from The Ensign to pass the time on a boring Sunday afternoon, who reads this and thinks \"that sounds totally metal \ud83e\udd18 I'm going to go and buy some now.\" This is free marketing.</p> <p>I know this was written in the early 80's, but this publication led by prophets and apostles (or their delegated correlation committee) is using the same misguided reasoning behind the failed D.A.R.E. program\u2014 if we tell kids &amp; teenagers about how bad hallucinogenic drugs are, they're more likely to seek out &amp; obtain hallucinogenic drugs. If we tell kids &amp; teenagers about how 'this garbage that you call music' has witchcraft and Satanism in it, the kids are more likely to encounter and consume it than if they had been left to chance... because that makes it sound rad as hell.

Not only did she kiss a girl, but\u2014you're never going to believe this\u2014she liked it. The world's gone to hell in a handbasket, I tell you. I was fifteen or so when that song was being played on the radio, and I distinctly remember my ward's bishop calling a priesthood meeting with exactly as much hand-wringing and pearl-clutching as you're imagining, to tell us all about how this song is clearly the work of Satan to corrupt our generation's innocent youths.</p> <p>This Ensign article seems to be the exact same message, just iterated twenty years earlier.

Occultists are signified as being able to imitate priesthood power, such as healing practices. If a Baptist preacher tries to heal by the power of God, it's not authorized, so nothing happens. But if an occultist tries it, that's different. They are evidently able to tap into some power that is greater than the misguided variations of Christianity.

So, let's tell God's followers about the second time He'll come by, at a minimum of 2,024 years after the event you won't live to see! How is that relevant to anyone in those times?

Christian denominations that use English, including LDS, have a grammatical hurdle here: God as a proper noun, the name of a unique individual to be identified, is the same word as \"god\" as a concept, a noun, a role or title. This wouldn't be too troublesome if we didn't use that same lower-case word \"god\" to refer to both Jehovah the son, and Elohim the father.

If we attribute scripture to divine revelation from God, I think I could make an argument that perhaps not all are alike unto God. At least, not the God of the LDS church, as these problematic scriptures are exclusive to the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price. Moreover, if we're to believe that prophets represent God, obtain and disseminate God's will, and speak in God's behalf such that their voices are functionally indistinguishable, I take issue when those prophets say and do some offensively racist things.

[F]or much of its history\u2014from the mid-1800s until 1978\u2014the Church did not ordain men of black African descent to its priesthood or allow black men or women to participate in temple endowment or sealing ordinances.</p> <p>\ud83e\udd28 Didn't we just establish that \"all are alike unto God?\" Why would God's official restored church exclude a specific race for 126 years? Does God's official restored church not represent His will?</p> <p>I'd also like to point out this explicit acknowledgement that simply disallowing black men from holding priesthood authority cascades into other matters\u2014 if interracial marriage is also forbidden, that means anyone of African ancestry is simply not allowed to participate in saving ordinances. They can't be endowed nor sealed. Their families will not be together forever, explicitly because of Heavenly Father's plan. But don't worry too much, all are alike unto God. ... Maybe.</p> <p>Let's not overlook the nebulous \"mid-1800s\" timeframe. We can trace down to the day when this doctrine was established by the prophet of God, to lead His one, true church. It was Thursday, 5 February 1852, and finally reversed on Thursday, 1 June 1978. We're looking at 126 years, 3 months, and 27 days. 46,137 days of God, eternal and unchanging, being either completely oblivious or complacent before ultimately revealing that \"actually, black folks are allowed to be saved now.\" Just a prank, bro.</p> <p> </p> <p>From the beginnings of the Church, people of every race and ethnicity could be baptized and received as members. Toward the end of his life, Church founder Joseph Smith openly opposed slavery.

How did Smith feel about slavery for the other ~35 years before that nonspecific turning point? Turns out, those years when Smith had something to say on the matter were the same years he was participating in the US presidential elections of 1844. Before then, not much. Oh, except for August 17, 1835, when Smith declared \"it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth... but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them[.]\" Maybe that time didn't count, even though it's recorded in D&amp;C, the church's standard works of scriptural records. Also moving into Missouri, a slave state, didn't seem to cause anyone's \"spidey-senses\" to tingle, as it were.</p> <p>\"There's never been a churchwide policy on segregated congregations\" sounds like a hefty qualifier as well. It's even got a footnote on that sentence:</p> <p>At some periods of time, reflecting local customs and laws, there were instances of segregated congregations in areas such as South Africa and the U.S. South.</p> <p>It wasn't churchwide, though, so I guess we can just ignore the admittance of racial segregation in Mormon wards. \ud83d\ude44</p> <p> </p> <p>During the first two decades of the Church\u2019s existence, a few black men were ordained to the priesthood. One of these men, Elijah Abel, also participated in temple ceremonies [. . .] and was later baptized as proxy for deceased relatives in Nauvoo, Illinois. There is no reliable evidence that any black men were denied the priesthood during Joseph Smith\u2019s lifetime.</p> <p>So... is there unreliable evidence of that? For an organization with a vested interest in one angle of a narrative to acknowledge and exclude evidence makes me think that evidence is worth examining. It makes me think that the reader should be the one to determine reliability.</p> <p>Asserting that there's \"no reliable evidence\" during Joseph Smith's presidency isn't quite the flex you seem to think it is. If we were to excuse him, we still have 11 other acting presidents of God's true, restored church to examine, not to mention their respective apostles and first presidencies, all of whom are called as prophets to bring God's will to us common folk. The easiest example to point to is Brigham Young's presidency, where we find some pretty unambiguous documentation on God's chosen vessel, representative, spokesman, being racist as fuck. Joseph's presidency has some conflicting information about racial dispositions\u2014 one day he\u2019s for equality, others not so much. How should I feel about the idea that both men were called of God to be a prophet? I don't like the idea of pinning all of this on Joseph Smith. He's got his own set of issues to sort through, but this doctrine on race persisted well beyond Joseph's lifetime, lasting for an uncomfortably long time.</p> <p> </p> <p>I recognize the sensitivity of this topic, and hope I can present it diplomatically\u2014 we can point to Elijah Abel as being among the first black men to receive priesthood ordination, but...</p> <p>Little is known about Able\u2019s early life. He was born in Maryland sometime between 1808 and 1812 to Andrew and Delilah William Able. Able had one black great-grandparent, apparently on his father\u2019s side.</p> <p>Huh. I wonder what the footnote in that paragraph says.</p> <p>Able was characterized as octoroon (one-eighth black) according to nomenclature used at the time.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude10</p> <p>But we'll gladly point to Elijah as our mascot for racial equality during Joseph Smith's day. Smith was definitely not racist, see?</p> <p>I've encountered numerous references to Brigham Young revoking Abel's authority, but have yet to find a satisfying source for that claim. Maybe it happened. Sounds about on-brand for Young to do that. Speaking of...</p> <p> </p> <p>In 1852, President Brigham Young publicly announced that men of black African descent could no longer be ordained to the priesthood, though thereafter blacks continued to join the Church through baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Following the death of Brigham Young, subsequent Church presidents restricted blacks from receiving the temple endowment or being married in the temple. Over time, Church leaders and members advanced many theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these explanations is accepted today as the official doctrine of the Church.</p> <p>The prophet, seer, revelator, spokesman for God, God's mouthpiece, the one for whom God's voice is manifest through, \"publicly announced\" that these human beings can't be given priesthood authority. Was that revelation? I guess we can drive by that point, since in the same sentence, we read that black people did still continue to join and be baptized, so I guess it's all good and fine then.</p> <p>Unless things changed more than I realize, being \"restricted\" from being endowed or having a temple marriage is a direct result of being restricted from priesthood authority. To clarify that this happened \"following the death of Brigham Young\" does pass some of the blame from Young to Taylor et al., but it also presents us with a different challenge. If we're to believe that Joseph Smith was agreeable enough to grant black men priesthood authority, and \"subsequent Church presidents\" made things progressively worse, can I conclude that the modern LDS church is far displaced from what Joseph restored?</p> <p>Why would leaders &amp; members alike \"[advance] many theories to explain\" the restriction? Was it not presented by the prophet of God? Are there more examples of leaders &amp; members advancing theories to explain what other church president have said? Why are we framing it as \"advancing many theories?\" It's either from God, or it isn't. Isn't this the same Skin of blackness that is a curse from God? How much room for interpretation is there?</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Commentated%20Docs/Essay%20Race%20Priesthood/#the-church-in-an-american-racial-culture","title":"The Church in an American Racial Culture","text":"<p>The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority that had been used to argue for the legalization of black \u201cservitude\u201d in the Territory of Utah.

Forget wars and genocides, Canaan saw his dad's dong once after getting passed out drunk. It wasn't even Ham who incurred such an awful infraction.

Unlike the United States and South Africa where legal and de facto racism led to deeply segregated societies, Brazil prided itself on its open, integrated, and mixed racial heritage. In 1975, the Church announced that a temple would be built in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. As the temple construction proceeded, Church authorities encountered faithful black and mixed-ancestry Latter-day Saints who had contributed financially and in other ways to the building of the S\u00e3o Paulo temple, a sanctuary they realized they would not be allowed to enter once it was completed. Their sacrifices, as well as the conversions of thousands of Nigerians and Ghanaians in the 1960s and early 1970s, moved Church leaders.</p> <p>What? The entire world doesn't see race the way America does? ... And the prophet of God for the entire world didn't anticipate that? Crazy how bad PR can really motivate God to change doctrines.</p> <p>This reminds me of the hand-waving I've encountered for treatment of LGBT folks\u2014 \"we're not turning them away, they're welcome to attend sacrament meeting!\" I mean, yeah, but they still can't participate in all of the requisite saving ordinances. To assert \"we never prevented black folks from being baptized\" is missing the point. They can't get into the temple, even if they paid money to construct it. What this sounds like to me is God wasn't involved in this decision to put a temple in S\u00e3o Paulo.

Who said anything about church leaders not being perfect? How is their perfection (or lack thereof) related to the church being true?</p> <p>We shifted from Christ having established a church (maybe) and the next heading, \"Why are you accusing me of not being perfect? It's fine, I never said that I was! Why are you being so hostile to church leaders?\" ... what? Is that related to the thesis statement? Perfect leadership wasn't part of the conversation on doctrine or truthfulness until Elder Cornish brought it up in a remarkably defensive way. We're like four paragraphs in, and we've escalated to defending imperfections.</p> <p>Perhaps some are hesitant to testify of the truth of the Church because they sense that the Church and its leaders may not be perfect. Indeed, neither the Church nor its leaders are perfect, nor have they claimed to be! It is noteworthy that nowhere in the scriptures or the teachings of Church leaders is it stated that the purpose of the Lord was to perfect the Church.</p> <p></p> <p>That's a nice strawman you've got there.</p> <p> </p> <p>So the purpose of the Lord is the perfecting of the Saints, not the perfecting of the Church. We can take real comfort from that principle because it implies that there is room in the Lord\u2019s Church for all of us imperfect people!</p> <p>... You were just talking about leadership. \"all of us imperfect people\" sounds like you're trying now to include the layman congregants who attend church weekly. I suppose both groups qualify as \"imperfect,\" but this doesn't have anything to do with your previous statement, nor your thesis statement of the church's truthfulness claims mean. See me after class.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sometimes we defend a concept about the way the Lord deals with the leaders and members of His Church that does not serve us well. We might expect that the Lord should control everything that leaders and administrators in the Church do so that no mistakes of any kind can be made. It may be better to recognize that the Lord gives guidance to those servants as they prayerfully do their best in their respective charges to direct His work. That is how loving parents teach their children.</p> <p>You mean like the time when God \"guided\" Joseph Smith, prophet of the restoration, by sending an angel with a flaming sword to destroy him if he doesn't cheat on his wife? Are you led by God or not? Because if you have a convenient explanation for why something you did was not inspired of God each time it's found to be disagreeable, I might question how divinely inspired your organization is.</p> <p>A fellow named L. Tom Perry did make a pretty definitive statement that \"a Bishop Must Be Blameless\" in 1982. No, \"blameless\" and \"perfect\" are not synonymous, but I'd wager there's lots of overlap in those adjectives. Dallin H Oaks is on record conflating policy and doctrine as being indistinguishable. Make of that what you will. </p> <p> </p> <p>The Lord gives us guidance but does not generally exercise control, except in matters that bear directly on our salvation. Once again, it is not His purpose to perfect the Church but rather to perfect His children, including Church leaders and administrators. This pattern of inspired operations at Church headquarters is not substantially different from that used in stakes and wards and homes.</p> <p>God isn't specific unless there's a doctrine you absolutely must follow to get into the celestial kingdom... unless it's about polygamy; you're on your own to figure out how to obey the commandment to marry multiple women. By the way, it's non-negotiable that you need polygamy to be exalted. He also does want you to come live with Him in heaven. Good luck!</p> <p>\"Stop claiming leaders have to be perfect.

Conveniently, the prophesies that are symbolic and vague are always specifically about us, here, today. This is the passage describing a stone cut out of mountains, rolling to full the earth. The connection to the Brighamite sect of the Latter-day Saint movement in 2024 is clear, don't you see it? These prophecies have been kept in God's back pocket until 1830, there is no possibility of it being fulfilled in the 2,400 years between Nebuchadnezzar's dream and the LDS church being founded. Give it time, the church hasn't been around for 200 years just yet, but it's totally going to fill the earth. Any minute now. Don't look at our membership statistics, please.</p> <p> </p> <p>We offer our full love and respect to all who believe in and follow truth wherever it may be found. We respect and value the radiant goodness we observe in so many other churches, and we do not criticize the beliefs of any group or individual. But it is folly to imagine that we can believe in Jesus Christ and the precepts He taught and receive the full benefit of the blessings and ordinances available only in His restored Church without believing in, championing, and defending that Church.</p> <p>We can all get along and share in common beliefs! ... But don't forget that only we can save you from eternal condemnation. Want to be friends? We're not a cult, by the way. In case you were wondering.</p> <p> </p> <p>... but there is also great importance in testifying of the truth of the Church as an institution. In the temple we learn that that is where our consecration is focused.</p> <p>LMAO YEAH THAT'S ONE WAY TO PUT IT</p> <p> </p> <p>The truths of the gospel do not require the defense and loyalty of the Saints to maintain them. They are true in and of themselves.</p> <p>my brother in christ, your opening statements were literally defending accusations of you not being perfect.</p> <p> </p> <p>But belief in general can become so vague as to have neither motivating nor saving power, and near-infidels can claim adherence (see James 2:19\u201320).</p> <p>Yes, I recall hearing this criticism of other varieties of Christianity when I was growing up. They're too superficial, they got no substance, no authority.</p> <p> </p> <p>By contrast, a conviction that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true and guided by the Lord leads one to attend meetings, pay tithes and offerings, serve in callings, receive ordinances, and keep the associated covenants. With clear belief and conviction come clear and compelling commitments. In other words, once we know it is true, we become morally obligated to act like it\u2019s true.</p> <p>\"As opposed to those silly guys playing church, we actually have clearly delineated steps. Don't ask what they are, please.\"</p> <p>We're better than Catholics with their definitive canon, catechism, Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults and its catechumenate stage of progression, ritualistic rosary prayers that all purports to say what they believe. We promise that you will receive ordinances. And tell you to keep the associated covenants. Makes you feel morally obligated to do volunteer work for the LDS church and pay for the privilege of doing so, doesn't it?</p> <p> </p> <p>Elder Cornish's closing remarks are a traditional testimony that the church is true. I suppose that, cutting out the fluff, he tells us that saying the church is true is synonymous with laying claim to authority. It'd be a shame if there was some discrepancy in how priesthood authority was restored and bestowed on Joseph. ...

He is always there to help you.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>We hear the words of the Lord most often by a feeling. If we are humble and sensitive, the Lord will prompt us through our feelings. That is why spiritual promptings move us on occasion to great joy, sometimes to tears. Many times my emotions have been made tender and my feelings very sensitive when touched by the Spirit.</p> <p>The Holy Ghost causes our feelings to be more tender. We feel more charitable and compassionate with each other. We are more calm in our relationships. We have a greater capacity to love each other. People want to be around us because our very countenances radiate the influence of the Spirit. We are more godly in our character. As a result, we become increasingly more sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and thus able to comprehend spiritual things more clearly.</p> <p>\u2014 Chapter 12, Seek the Spirit in All You Do, Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson</p> <p> </p> <p>On October 9, 1959, between sessions of general conference in Salt Lake City, Howard learned that President David\u00a0O.

You are called to be one of his special witnesses, and tomorrow you will be sustained as a member of the Council of the Twelve.\u201d Regarding that experience, Howard wrote:</p> <p>\u201cI cannot attempt to explain the feeling that came over me. Tears came to my eyes and I could not speak. I have never felt so completely humbled as when I sat in the presence of this great, sweet, kindly man\u2014the prophet of the Lord. He told me what a great joy this would bring into my life, the wonderful association with the brethren, and that hereafter my life and time would be devoted as a servant of the Lord and that I would hereafter belong to the Church and the whole world. \u2026 He put his arms around me and assured me that the Lord would love me and I would have the sustaining confidence of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve. \u2026 I [told him] I would gladly give my time, my life, and all that I possessed to this service.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as Howard left President McKay\u2019s office, he went to his hotel room and called Claire, who was in Provo visiting their son John and his wife and their baby. At first Howard could hardly speak. When he finally told Claire of the calling, they were both overcome with emotion.</p> <p>\u2014 The Life and Ministry of Howard W.

In this connection, may I offer a suggestion to all of us? If we truly desire to know the Prophet, we must go to the right source\u2014and that is not a Google search. As President Ezra Taft Benson taught, \u201cToday, with the abundance of books available, it is the mark of a truly educated man to know what not to read.\u201d The Lord gave us the key to knowing Joseph Smith when he said, \u201cseek ye out of the best books words of wisdom.\u201d And what are the best books? They are the scriptures.

Mr Kunzler? I... I can't think of a more polite way to remind you of this, but you're speaking at an accredited university, telling people that education means just reading scriptures, not researching independently. If I had heard this being proliferated at Virginia Tech, UCLA, or Berkley, I would lose respect for those institutions. BYU is a university, and students are being told to not read.</p> <p>\"abandon all hope <code>critical thinking</code>, ye who enter here\"</p> <p> </p> <p>While we're in proximity to this devotional and quote, I'll advise readers to follow the cited link and read (or listen) for yourselves. An opening remark is Bruce McConkie panicking that missionaries in the '80's didn't rank Joseph Smith as being comparably important as God. Go check for yourself. No, we're not a cult.</p> <p> </p> <p>An educated person can read things and determine whether or not it's bullshit. I will argue that knowing how to interpret information is one \"mark of a truly educated man.\" Being able to differentiate misinformation takes both intuition and experience. Knowing what is credible, what to rely on, what to take at face value. This sounds to me like Benson, president of the church, was suggesting that an educated person should only read scriptures. ... But not the Bible, since that's conveniently not \"translated correctly\" whenever we decide that it is. So just the Book of Mormon, D&amp;C, and Pearl of Great Price. Except for the Book of Abraham, which might not have anything to do with Abraham. Doctrine &amp; Covenants... eh, maybe. Not section 132, for sure. You know what, just read the Book of Mormon. Just that one. That's what will make you educated. Reading only one book with its myriad anachronisms and lack of historical quality is all you need. That will make you smarter than all those dorks with their \"degrees\" and \"certificates.\"</p> <p>For what it's worth, one demonstration of untrustworthy information today is AI-generated texts, or summaries of searches. Those are a fairly recent breakthrough, and they aren't always reliable. How much education do you need to understand that when Google tells you that eating rocks is good for your health, it is not reliable information? What I'm hearing instead is that an educated person simply never reads anything that isn't a specific religious text. I can get behind Kunzler's admonition to not take Google's top results as objective truth. However, I also wish to point out that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) from the LDS church ensures that their curated pages are at the top of online searches. SEO isn't something to really delve into as a side note, but suffice it to say that SEO is both arranging and organizing one's webpage for webcrawlers to index, and the other part of SEO is \"paying Google lots of money to put these results before others.\" After all, you can buy anything in this world with money.</p> <p> </p> <p>Maybe I'm being too harsh, and the intended context is seeking information about a church leader instead of education on a broader perspective. I could imagine that being a fair defense.</p> <p>I'm willing to concede that I'm just some grump, but Alma's war chapters, Ether's barges and holocaust-scale deaths, Teancum throwing a javelin through enemy military leaders, nor Nephite women being violated are going to help me understand one Russell Marion Nelson better. Actually, if those tales did help me understand Nelson better, I think that connection would warrant further examination and scrutiny.

Many instructions were subsequently given to the Prophet including Section 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants: \"And again, we would suggest for your consideration the propriety of all the saints gathering up a knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and abuses put upon them. . . .</p> <p>\" And also of all the property and amount of damages which they have sustained, both of character and personal injuries. . . .</p> <p>\" And also the names of all persons that have had a hand in their oppressions, as far as they can get hold of them and find them out.</p> <p>\" And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find out these things, and to take statements and affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous publications that are afloat;</p> <p>\" And all that are in the magazines, and in the encyclopedias, and all the libelous histories that are published. . . . (Verses 1-5.)'</p> <p>\"Leaders and members of the Church strive to implement commandments of the Lord including this direction received in 1839. Because the Church has a non-professional clergy, its stake presidents and bishops have varied backgrounds and training. In order to assist their members who have questions, these local leaders often request information from General Authorities of the Church.</p> <p>\"The Strengthening Church Members Committee was appointed by the First Presidency to help fulfill this need and to comply with the cited section of the Doctrine and Covenants. This committee serves as a resource to priesthood leaders throughout the world who may desire assistance on a wide variety of topics. It is a General Authority committee, currently comprised of Elder James E. Faust and Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. They work through established priesthood channels, and neither impose nor direct Church disciplinary action.</p> <p>\"Members who have questions concerning Church doctrine, policies, or procedures have been counseled to discuss those concerns confidentially with their local leaders. These leaders are deeply aware of their obligation to counsel members wisely in the spirit of love, in order to strengthen their faith in the Lord and in His great latter-day work.\"</p> <p>The First Presidency</p> <p>\u2014 First Presidency statement cites scriptural mandate for Church committee, Church News Archives, 22 Aug 1992</p> <p> </p> <p>Whelp...

I grew up in the United States, born and raised as a Mormon, a subcategory of Christianity. I can only offer conjecture at this point\u2014but I'm curious about non-Christian faiths' teachings about what happens after death. I'll likely add more notes here once I take time to read about this topic. From my perspective as of early 2025, the Christian afterlife really seems to be appealing to human ego. </p> <p>Some strawman examples would be \"I can't simply cease to exist. I'm too important to just end.\" \"Some aspect of who I am must persist even after my mortal body expires.\" \"Not only will I will continue to exist after death, but I will exist alongside the God whom I grew up revering. ... Also, people who disagree with me will also continue to exist, but they'll get the sad version.\"</p> <p>A very cynical outlook on this teaching is that it's a tool for a ruler to control subjects. It's a carrot-and-stick approach of promising reward and punishment. A constable officer can levy punishment for crimes visibly committed. But what does an illiterate peasant do when, in twelfth-century England, no one is around to witness some misdoing such as petty theft? The ruling class can't have him or her getting too bold, so... Now Christianity teaches that there is an invisible, omniscient force, always present to witness your actions, and even your thoughts. You won't know it until after you die, but this divine presence is keeping track, and if you mess up badly enough, you'll burn and suffer forever. Conversely, you get to live a carefree existence, luxuriating forever if you're obedient to what your pastor says.</p> <p>Trouble is, as with many promises that religions make, none of this gets realized until you're dead.

Why? You're left conscious and aware with no stimulation. Humans like novelty. Keeping someone confined and alone is widely considered torturous. Prisoners lose their sense of time passing, distorting their estimation of how long they've been confined. Three weeks can feel like ten years in a windowless, featureless room.

We searched and searched for something appropriate, and finding nothing in our area, we drove three hours to Salt Lake City. There we found a beautiful and perfectly modest pink gown. Her sacrifice of time showed me that dressing modestly was important to her. And it was at that dance I realized how important it had become to me as well. I felt like a princess in my dress.

God begins what is called a dispensation by designating a prophet who is authorized to speak in His behalf. This process becomes necessary when no living person holds priesthood authority\u2014a period of time or state known as apostasy. This is emphasized pretty heavily in missionary teaching material. A dispensation begins with a religious adherence to the teachings of  Yahweh, Jehovah, Yeshua bar Yosef, or Jesus Christ, but the organization over time befalls corruption or the priesthood holders meet a violent end. (Good plan, God! \ud83d\udc4d) As a Mormon missionary, I propogated the idea that by the end of the New Testament, Christ's authorized apostles had been killed off, and so the world was once again in a state of apostasy.</p> <p>This must be true, or else the LDS church doesn't really have a leg to stand on. This is foundational to its claims to legitimacy.</p> <p> </p> <p>The LDS church presents this context to Joseph Smith being called as a prophet to restore Jesus' original, true church. The First Vision takes place (maybe) through Joseph, a banal &amp; unremarkable teenager in New York state, who is advised that all other Christian denominations have strayed. No matter that they're each convinced that they're \"correct\" or legitimate representatives of Christ and His teachings. The notion that all other varieties of Christianity are misled, unauthorized and corrupt is the entire premise on which Mormonism is built!</p> <p>What isn't explicitly outlined here is that when Christ's authorized church needs course correction, God calls in an outsider when calling a prophet to start over. The pattern that I see is that God doesn't contact the leadership of the established church(es) to caution them that their actions are causing them to fall into apostasy as, presumably, that wouldn't work.

Joseph was not in a position of influence. Joseph was not in the Vatican, nor was he part of the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee. Smith was a simple farm boy who maybe wasn't all that smart. God Himself and Jesus Christ appear to Joseph Smith, an outsider, to restore the official church. Not the Pope. Not a presbyterian deacon. Not a baptist minister. Just some dork kid in New York.</p> <p>An issue with mortal men claiming authority to speak for God and to officially represent His church is that lay members have no way of verifying leaderships' claims. In fact, in modern times, us lay people are advised in no uncertain terms that decrees from leadership must be divinely appointed, or else God wouldn't let them lead. Since they're leading, they are therefore divinely appointed, and everything they say is indistinguishable from God's own words!</p> <p> </p> <p>For a thought-exercise, pick your preferred boogeyman scapegoat religious institution as a stand-in. Now imagine what if God actually had appeared in the Vatican in or prior to 1820 to advise the Pope directly that the Catholic church had strayed and needs course correction? If an effect of apostasy is corruption, Catholic leadership (in this hypothetical thought-exercise scenario) would have no incentive outside of altruism to upend their entire life's work and theological worldview.</p> <p>It's still up to those leaders to disseminate that message and comply with the directive. Would they tell the rest of the world? What if the bishop or cardinal in question gets expelled for heretical blasphemy? What if word never gets out? If a powerful church didn't want people to know about corruption, they could very easily just keep on keepin' on. When God decrees course correction, it doesn't come from established leadership, it happens from the outside.</p> <p> </p> <p>Can we agree that God doesn't inspire reform from the top-down? What if He tried from the bottom-up? After all, God wouldn't just... lean back and watch passively as credulous followers live a lie, would He? If the leadership couldn't be trusted to comply with course correction, shouldn't God somehow advise or tell the general membership that their church had strayed, and to not trust their corrupt leaders? God doesn't seem interested in even advising church congregants that something is amiss. If Mormonism's claim of apostasy is true, then this lack of communication from God is worrisome.

He knew that he had not only his own prejudices and prepossessions to combat and to overcome, but those of the whole Christian world stared him in the face; but God, who is above all, had given the commandment, and He must be obeyed. Yet the Prophet hesitated and deferred from time to time, until an angel of God stood by him with a drawn sword, and told him that, unless he moved forward and established plural marriage, his Priesthood would be taken from him and he should be destroyed!

I've added line breaks for readability, but this is copied directly from the above link:</p> <p>Emma Smith struggled with JS\u2019s new marriages in the months leading up to July 1843. Since the beginning of 1843, JS was sealed to at least thirteen additional wives, most of whom were married to him without Emma\u2019s knowledge.</p> <p>Although details regarding Emma\u2019s reactions to JS\u2019s practice of plural marriage prior to 1843 are scarce, she evidently came to accept the doctrine, albeit temporarily, by May of that year, on the condition that she could choose the women to whom JS would be sealed. That month, she selected Eliza and Emily Partridge, who were then ages twenty-three and nineteen and living in the Smith household, as potential marriage partners to JS. In fact, JS had already been sealed to the sisters two months earlier.</p> <p>JS and the Partridge sisters sought to avoid confrontation by repeating the marriages, with Emma\u2019s blessing, as if for the first time. Likely during the same month, Emma suggested JS marry Maria and Sarah Lawrence, ages nineteen and sixteen or seventeen, another pair of sisters who were living in the Smith household. However, Emily Partridge later testified that Emma became embittered \u201csoon after\u201d the Partridge sisters\u2019 second wedding ceremony.</p> <p>\"man, Emma got real bitchy after she found out that her husband got married to me behind her back, and then again for a second time just for theatrics.

Sealing was originally about justifying polygamy and nothing else. Joseph Smith was sealed to twenty-two other women before he was ever sealed to Emma, and he was never sealed to his parents or his own children while he was alive. That\u2019s how real sealing was to Joseph. That\u2019s how important it was. It wasn\u2019t about family at all. He used it to give legitimacy to his adulterous affairs.

Sex wasn't an activity that two humans engaged in together, it was done to a recipient by an initiating agent. Sexual orientation wasn't a social construct, nor a relevant factor until around the 19th century. An agent's chosen recipient was deemed by the recipient's relative standing in a social hierarchy rather than biology. Ancient Southwestern Asia positions free-born citizen men at the top of this social hierarchy. Below them are men who are not free-born (slaves, serfs, etc); below them are women. In this culture, sex is \"performed\" or \"done to\" someone below the initiating agent\u2014not the other way around. Whoever is \"on top\" in the social structure is also \"on top\" en coitus\u2014not the other way around. Any reversal of this order would be a breach of social and cultural boundaries.</p> <p>How does this context affect the admonition against \"a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman\"? Our modern cultural framework sees the biological indicators and roles of men and women, and understandably, we piece together what the equivocated action is. What cultural context tells us is that rather than forbidding same-sex relations outright, this biblical passage is forbidding scorn of the hierarchy.</p> <p>There is absolutely no condemnation of same-sex relations within the same social hierarchical stratum. Free-born citizen men can engage with each other without breaking these rules. Lesbians are not forbidden or condemned in any way. Lest we try to extrapolate, I will direct your attention to context surrounding the verses in Leviticus 18 and 20 where rules for women are explicitly outlined concerning things like bestiality. Outlining parameters for women is suspiciously absent for the verses condemning whom one should \"lay with.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Who is the target audience for this documented teaching? Who is the book of Leviticus written to? It wouldn't be to illiterate people in the subservient class. Women weren't really treated as humans around 500 BCE, so there'd be no sense in preaching to them.

This was referred to as \"blood atonement.\" Since such a theocracy has not been operative in modern times, the practical effect of the idea was its use as a rhetorical device to heighten the awareness of Latter-day Saints of the seriousness of murder and other major sins.

These claims are false and were known by their originators to be false. There is not one historical instance of so-called blood atonement in this dispensation, nor has there been one event or occurrence whatever, of any nature, from which the slightest inference arises that any such practice either existed or was taught.</p> <p>. . .</p> <p>But under certain circumstances there are some serious sins for which the cleansing of Christ does not operate, and the law of God is that men must then have their own blood shed to atone for their sins. Murder, for instance, is one of these sins; hence we find the Lord commanding capital punishment. Thus, also, if a person has so progressed in righteousness that his calling and election has been made sure, if he has come to that position where he knows \"by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood\" that he is sealed up unto eternal life (D. &amp; C. 131:5), then if he gains forgiveness for certain grievous sins, he must \"be destroyed in the flesh,\" and \"delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.\" (D. &amp; C. 132:19-27.)</p> <p>President Joseph Fielding Smith has written: \"Man may commit certain grievous sins - according to his light and knowledge - that will place him beyond the reach of the atoning blood of Christ. If then he would be saved, he must make sacrifice of his Own life to atone - so far as in his power lies - for that sin, for the blood of Christ alone under certain circumstances will not avail. . . . Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will place the transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf\" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 133-138.)

Throughout the century, revivalists had used violent imagery to encourage the unconverted to repent and to urge backsliders to reform. At times during the reformation, President Young, his counselor Jedediah\u00a0M. Grant, and other leaders preached with fiery rhetoric, warning against the evils of those who dissented from or opposed the Church. Drawing on biblical passages, particularly from the Old Testament, leaders taught that some sins were so serious that the perpetrator\u2019s blood would have to be shed in order to receive forgiveness. Such preaching led to increased strain between the Latter-day Saints and the relatively few non-Mormons in Utah, including federally appointed officials.</p> <p>\u2014 Peace and Violence among 19th-Century Latter-day Saints, Gospel Topics Essays</p> <p>\"And we never talked about it again after that, easing the strain between LDS and heathen outsiders forever.\"</p> <p>And let's not miss it for a third time, \"19th century Americans were used to this because it was super-normal.\" \"It was all just rhetoric, calm down.

While many of the exaggerated claims that appeared in the popular press and anti-Mormon literature are easily disproven, it is likely that in at least one instance, a few Latter-day Saints acted on this rhetoric. Nevertheless, most Latter-day Saints seem to have recognized that the blood atonement sermons were, in the words of historian Paul Peterson, \u201chyperbole or incendiary talk\u201d that were \u201clikely designed to frighten church members into conforming with Latter-day Saint principles.

Joseph Smith taught that there were certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will place the transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ. If these offenses are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf. This is scriptural doctrine, and is taught in all the standard works of the Church.

Well anyway, right before the book's index is Works Cited and Abbreviations Used. It does list \"JD\" as an abbreviation used in place of Journal of Discourses.

Not six months before the death of Joseph, he called his wife Emma into a secret council, and there he told her the truth, and called upon her to deny it if she could. He told her that the judgments of God would come upon her forthwith if she did not repent. He told her of the time she undertook to poison him, and he told her that she was a child of hell, and literally the most wicked woman on this earth, that there was not one more wicked than she. He told here where she got the poison, and how she put it in a cup of coffee; said he \u2018You got that poison from so and so, and I drank it, but you could not kill me.\u2019 When it entered his stomach he went to the door and threw it off. he spoke to her in that council in a very severe manner, and she never said one word in reply.

Here are some possibilities:</p> <ol> <li>Brigham Young is lying in General Conference about the wife of the prophet of the restoration</li> <li>The Smiths, being mortal, imperfect people had a strained marriage, both people were under tremendous stress, escalating to civil disagreement; Brigham's exaggerated retelling then gets blown out of proportion</li> <li>Emma tried to fucking murder Joseph, sick of his shit</li> </ol> <p>The only source for this is a prophet of God, in general conference, where the prophet prophesies, where the authorized Church of God disperses revelation to people\u2026 so\u2026 maybe it didn\u2019t actually happen?</p> <p>To date, I have never ingested poison that my wife slipped into my coffee. I feel pretty confident in the claim that she is not trying to murder me. I mention this to emphasize that I have no idea what the expected reaction would be. I think an important consideration is the possibility that Joseph was incredibly stressed, paranoid, perhaps fearful of other people trying to take his life. I speculate that this could have culminated in him tasting something just slightly off, and immediately jumping to the worst conclusion that his wife is trying to poison him. What is clear, though, is Brigham sharing this information at face value with the pretense that Emma is the damnedest liar, unrepentant, wicked, etc etc. I should hope he's not spreading misinformation at General Conference.

The first of these, known today as Joseph Smith\u2014History, was canonized in the Pearl of Great Price and thus became the most well-known account.

Very little was made of the First Vision in Church teachings until 1839 when for the first time the story of the vision appeared in print, in an account by Orson Pratt. The familiar 1838 account was not published until 1842. Joseph mentioned his experience to a visitor to Kirtland in 1835, but did not tell the story in any sermon we know about. Likely no more than a handful of Latter-day Saints had even heard of the First Vision before 1839.</p> <p>Its notable absence from Church writings until 1839 is quite surprising.

Does it have any bearing on God the Father and Jesus Christ appearing to restore the one true church? If a table has a boolean <code>TRUE</code> on every single column, then why is it even included? If you're trying to make a visually striking graph, then sure, add extraneous information. You could just as meaningfully have a field for \"Joseph was feeling indigestion\" or \"had encountered nine hippopotamuses\" with all columns indicating <code>FALSE</code>. Without any differentiation, why would it be included?</p> <p>He... he prayed? Holy shit, I had no idea.

Time to get back to church.</p> <p> </p> <p>One of Dr. Allen's points as quoted above is that the 1832 account is \"the most comprehensive of all\". I suppose that using it as a reference point does show corroboration with the other accounts, in that \"Joseph read scriptures and prayed.\" Those two factors would not convince anyone that he has been called to be a prophet.</p> <p>Per my stint at the Provo UT Missionary Training Center, and the insistence of my mission president(s), people need to know that Joseph was a prophet, and hearing God appearing to him to call him as such is what will invite the Spirit to testify accordingly. What factors on the above table lend credibility to this claim?</p> <p>Anyone can pray for forgiveness of sins. That is not unusual. Having a supernatural opposition inhibit verbal speech is unusual, but not indicative of priesthood authority. Having deity appear was not exclusive to Joseph. Hearing a divine figure testify of Jesus doesn't really impact a prophetic office.

I would think that the version recorded closest to the date of the event would be least tarnished by entropy. I would also think that the version recorded in Joseph's own handwriting would make it non-repudiable, and yet it's the most dramatically different outlier. We can't blame scribes for misquoting Joseph if he wrote down his own experience with his own hands. Why, then, have we disregarded these factors in deciding which version is canon? The church settled on the account recorded eighteen years after the event, ignoring the one that the prophet wrote by his own hand. </p> <p> </p> <p>I really don't think that \"i forgor \ud83d\udc80\" is a good explanation for omitting the presence of God.

I'm not trying to require that Joseph be able to describe down to the day precisely how old he was, but please recognize that despite the tremendous weight of the moment when divine figures appeared to Joseph, in no account does he narrow down when this happens. The closest we get is \"spring of 1820.\" We don't get a specific month to point to. Just a season.</p> <p>The absence of a definitive date for the First Vision is not the problem here. The problem is that Joseph can't consistently tell us anything specific about what would be among the most monumental events in human history. If I discover a specific date, that wouldn't make things more palatable\u2014the problem is that if this event mattered to him, Joseph would recollect vivid details about the day when the entirety of his worldview changed because fucking God Himself showed up to advise the prophet that no other church is true, which means that the eternal salvation of every human alive in that moment is in jeopardy, and it's up to this teenaged farmboy to restore the gospel as Christ Himself taught it, but he can't even remember when that happened. Some time in the spring when he was \"about fourteen\" is the best we get.</p> <p> </p> <p>In some accounts, Joseph will say he's \"in his fifteenth year\" or some variation. I don't think that phrasing lends to discrepancy. To us in the 21st century, it sounds odd, but to be \"fourteen years old\" suggests fourteen birthdays to have elapsed. We normally count age from 0, so to speak; we've had zero birthdays in our first year of life, so being in his sixteenth year would put him at fifteen years old.</p> <p>Sounds funny, but I don't see it as a problem.</p> <p> </p> <p>Joseph can point to specific dates for other milestone events (Aaronic priesthood restoration, church founding, Kirtland temple dedication, Nauvoo Expositor being destroyed, re-sealing dates for extramarital wives, sections in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants) but, wouldn't you know it, the one event that would render all others worthless if it lost credibility? No idea when it happened. Spring sometime, he was like 14 or something, who knows.</p> <p>I can tell you the specific dates of some key events in my life, many of which revolve around the LDS church: my baptism date, the day I went to get temple endowments, the day I went to the Missionary Training Center in Provo, the day I got married in the Salt Lake City temple, and the day I started my career job after graduating university. Each of those dates are important to me. None of those events are as consequential as God appearing to tell me that every variety of Christianity is wrong, and how much that pisses Him off (as shown in the 1832 account.)</p> <p> </p> <p>Did God appear to you or not, Joseph?

It'd sure look bad if you had to tell people about this twenty two years after the fact and have to just shrug your shoulders and say \"yeah, God appeared, said you were wrong, and maybe He'd tell me the truth later idk lol\"</p> <p>The reason why fussing over how old Joseph was is two-fold: he should be able to remember how old he was in a formative memory, and he should be able to identify the date of something as monumental as Elohim showing up for tea. If Joseph can't tell you when it happened, then it must not have been that formative, monumental, or important.

It's the 200th anniversary of something that definitely happened in 1820 don't scrutinize that claim please</p> <p>Nelson wanted to make another formal proclamation, because he won't rest until he can one-up Hinckley at every opportunity. This is what Nelson was excited about, to make it memorable and unforgettable. It's 200 years after the canonized record of the First Vision.</p> <p> </p> <p>What a curious choice of words these selected paragraphs have. They didn't seem to mention that Joseph made absolutely no record of this world-changing event for twelve years\u2014two years after the LDS Church was founded, precluding the notion that it was a Restoration.</p> <p>They did say in explicit terms that \"God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph ... [i]n this vision[.]\" Makes me think that they're trying to equivocate around saying that Elohim and Jehovah both were physically present in Palmyra, New York, without explicitly saying they were physically present. Having \"appeared\" \"in this vision\" is the right level of vague that can still hold some plausible deniability. Not quite as bold and declarative as I'd have expected. I mean, that would imply that the Second Coming already happened, or else that the Second one isn't actually the second appearance.</p> <p> </p> <p>Outside of nitpicking the vernacular, why was this proclamation necessary? The illustration \"preaching to the choir\" comes to mind. Who is for? A grand majority of folks tuning in to listen to this conference do so because they believe that the speakers are divinely inspired and authorized by God because of the First Vision. Nelson is invoking divine authority to assure believers in the First Vision that the First Vision happened, which means that Nelson is authorized to speak for God. It feels so circular to me.</p> <p>If you'd like to postulate that this proclamation is meant for non-members, that's fine, but please\u2014imagine this kind of proclamation from some other faith. If you were handed a printed proclamation by David Miscavige asserting that the publication of L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics is a key historical event for the world, would you think \"by my troth, this is all the definitive proof I needed! Sign me up for exorbitantly priced books, post-haste!\" Or some similar publication from Bob Ciranko of JW's Watchtower reminding you that 144,000 individuals will be sealed and \"are chosen from among mankind to rule with Christ in heaven over the coming Paradise earth\". Having read that in a formal proclamation issued by the upper echelons of a group you are not a part of, would such a proclamation sway your opinion of that organization?</p> <p>In either of these hypothetical scenarios, I might question why are these religious leaders proclaiming to the rest of the world? They're iterating a core belief that isn't new information. Most anyone familiar with Mormonism would know superficially about Joseph Smith claiming to have seen God and producing a text afterward. Imagine hearing Nelson's proclamation as a nonmember. What would you reaction be? Better yet\u2014find a non-Mormon friend of yours and share it to them. How do they react? If it didn't soften their heart and get them to agree to baptism, then what was the point of the proclamation? Was it intended to persuade nonmembers, or was it to assure existing members?</p> <p> </p> <p>Well, surely if Nelson hadn't used his prophetic mantle to warn us of COVID in 2019, maybe he did say something earlier?</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Prophets/Russell-Nelson/Nelson-vs-Covid/#vitamins","title":"Vitamins","text":"<p>Eat your vitamin pills!

The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: \"Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death.

I\u2019ve heard that Joseph Smith appeared; and then I heard another story that Spencer Kimball had had a concern about this for some time and simply shared it with the apostles, and they decided that this was the right time to move in that direction. Now are any of those stories true, or are they all\u2026</p> <p>RICHARDS:\u00a0Well, the last one is pretty true, and I might tell you what provoked it in a way. Down in Brazil, there is so much Negro blood in the population there that it\u2019s hard to get leaders that don\u2019t have Negro blood in them. We just built a temple down there. It\u2019s going to be dedicated in October. All those people with Negro blood in them have been raising the money to build that temple. And then, if we don\u2019t change, then they can\u2019t even use it. So Brother Kimball worried about it, and he prayed a lot about it.</p> <p>He asked each one of us of the Twelve if we would pray \u2013 and we did \u2013 that the Lord would give him the inspiration to know what the will of the Lord was. And then he invited each one of us in his office \u2013 individually, because you know when you are in a group, you can\u2019t always express everything that\u2019s in your heart. You\u2019re part of the group, you see \u2013 so he interviewed each one of us, personally, to see how we felt about it, and he asked us to pray about it. And then he asked each one of us to hand in all the references we had, for, or against that proposal. See, he was thinking favorably toward giving the colored people the priesthood.</p> <p>Then we had a meeting where we meet every week in the temple, and we discussed it as a group together, and then we prayed about it in our prayer circle, and then we held another prayer circle after the close of that meeting, and he (President Kimball) lead in the prayer; praying that the Lord would give us the inspiration that we needed to do the thing that would be pleasing to Him and for the blessing of His children. And then the next Thursday \u2013 we meet every Thursday \u2013 the Presidency came with this little document written out to make the announcement \u2013 to see how we\u2019d feel about it \u2013 and present it in written form.

Find the rest of their article on their site.</p> <p> </p> <p>[T]he \u201cskin of blackness\u201d Nephi describes falling upon the Lamanites was not necessarily physical but was given in the context of some people violating the Lord\u2019s covenant and thereby being \u201ccut off from the presence of the Lord,\u201d bringing upon themselves the sore cursing that Lehi had warned of previously. In other words, the Lamanites had simply experienced what Alma later calls \u201cspiritual death\u201d and thus their souls were in spiritual darkness (Alma 42:9).</p> <p>\ud83d\ude10 Right, okay</p> <p>Re-read the offending passage that describes \"skin of blackness,\" if it isn't fresh in your memory. Nephi's people\u2014whose hearts were not hardened\u2014\"were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome.\" Evidently, the Lord did not want white, fair, and delightsome Lamanites who had hardened their hearts against him to be enticing to the Nephites, so \u201cthe Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.\u201d I'd have a hard time finding a way around this\u2014the Lamanites had hardened their hearts against the Lord, but were still white, fair, and delightsome, so the Lord cursed them with \u201ca skin of blackness\u201d to make them unappealing enough to differentiate them. What the hell, God?</p> <p>The words \"white,\" \"fair,\" and \"delightsome\" don't seem to refer to spiritual purity, since the Lamanites were hard-hearted at the same time they were \"white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome.\" Or, thinking of it from another angle, the phrase \u201cskin of blackness\u201d is contingent on hardheadedness, meaning it cannot refer to hard-heartedness or spiritual darkness. This \"curse\" is the result, not the condition.</p> <p>It sounds to me like Nephi's description of a \u201cskin of blackness\u201d must refer to something other than \"spiritual death.\" If it wasn't physically visible, there would be no noticeable difference between pre- and post-curse Lamanites. Hardheartedness doesn't seem to be genetically inherited, since later in the Book of Mormon, those dirty non-white barbarians became the righteous ones to earn God's favor.

If this theory is correct, Welch noted, \u201cthe Lamanites and Amlicites were distinguishing themselves by the things they chose to wear or put upon themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Clothing. We'll defend the idea that God cursed people who were white and delightsome \"that they might not be enticing unto my people\" by... giving them ugly clothes.</p> <p></p> <p>For what it's worth, a poor fashion taste could be off-putting. I don't think the scriptural record describes much about the dating scene in ancient America. How did God cause, or force, the Lamanites to wear clothing that was dark? An affiliate deal with Hot Topic? How did God keep the Nephites' clothing white to distinguish from the Lamanites? What would prevent the Lamanites from wearing white clothing? How did this curse of clothing extend to their descendants? Scripture Central, do you hear yourselves as you make this statement?</p> <p>Right, okay, yes, the word \"skin\" appears in other contexts.

Art from the Classic Maya period illustrates that many elites \u201cdarkened their skins with paints, stains, and pigments for ceremonial purposes and as camouflage for warfare, hunting, and plunder.\u201d This fits with Nephi\u2019s reference to a \u201cskin of blackness\u201d in close association to describing the Lamanites as hunters \u201cin the wilderness for beasts of prey.\u201d Furthermore, the first occasion in which Nephi and his people encountered the Lamanites after being separated from them was likely during their \u201cwars and contentions\u201d (2\u202fNephi 5:24,\u202f34). The Amlicites also mark themselves in a military context (Alma 3:4).</p> <p>Slow down, now, Mr. Steenblik... This is a manifestation of a curse we're talking about. Keep your eye on the ball\u2014 we're trying to defend the idea that being cursed with dark skin doesn't have racial implications. Sure, war paint exists.

Presumably, with or without body paint? I can concede that I've never felt hot &amp; bothered by seeing a woman donning war paint. Does that body paint persist across generations?

Tattooing was known in the ancient Near East and in the Americas among various Indigenous tribes in both North and South America. In Mesoamerica, it can be documented from as early as 1400\u202fBC among the Olmec and, later, the Maya, as the practice was continued up through the Spanish Conquest. Most tattooing in ancient America was black, but some evidence exists for red tattoos at Chichen Itza, thus accounting for both the black or dark skin of the Lamanites and the red mark of the Amlicites (Alma 3:4).</p> <p></p> <p>Look, I don't even know what to say at this point. Yeah, tattooing is also a practice among humans, irrespective of God's sore cursings. Are we implying that God tattooed the Lamanites in order to make them loathsome? Don't forget that \"the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.\" They aren't cursed because they got tattoos, the curse is tattoos... According to this, one of three possible theories. Also isn't this curse is contingent that \"they shall repent of their iniquities?\" And also is hereditary?</p> <p> </p> <p>Scripture Central presents those three possible interpretations as alternatives to what the text states in a way I would describe as pretty explicit. We don't need to do these mental gymnastics, tying ourselves in knots to get around the idea that skin might not literally mean skin, since it would make the church look bad. Occam's Razor would have us incline toward the simpler of these explanations: a) it's spiritual, symbolic, maybe clothing, war paint, or tattoos; or b) it's racism.</p> <p>I'll emphasize the point that three possible interpretations are presented. Why not one interpretation? Is this testament of Christ symbolic, up to individual interpretation? Are other factors open to discussion to settle on what it means? Was Jesus' visit to Zerahemla symbolic, open to interpretation? This passage right here sure sounds troubling when taken at face value, and there seems to be three or more ways to interpret it outside of vitriolic racism, so... does that mean that the Book of Mormon is also \"the word of God as far as it is translated correctly\"?</p> <p>Can't we just acknowledge bad ideas, learn from mistakes, and commit to do better? In a parallel universe, Scripture Central would instead be writing an essay commenting on the Church's ability to admit fault, grow and develop, moving past prejudiced ideologies, and perhaps even frame it in a faith-promoting angle. God is patient and understanding.</p> <p>Maybe, even with a prophet, we don't get the ongoing restoration nailed down perfectly the first time around. Maybe in the grand, eternal scheme of things, a poor choice of words is something God could still work with. Instead, we have leaders insisting that the Book of Mormon is perfect, directly from God, take it or leave it. I would think that a church which claims to be led by a living spokesman for God would verify with the big guy upstairs that this scripture passage really reflects His will? Because if it didn't, we could use that as an illustration of Joseph Smith's shortcomings that don't involve him getting thrown in prison.

These are rewards and punishments, fully in harmony with His established policy in dealing with sinners and saints, rewarding all according to their deeds.</p> <p> </p> <p>When He placed the mark upon Cain, He engaged in segregation. When he told Enoch not to preach the gospel to the descendants of Cain who were black, the Lord engaged in segregation. When He cursed the descendants of Cain as to the Priesthood, He engaged in segregation</p> <p> </p> <p>The Lord segregated the people both as to blood and place of residence. At least in the case of the Lamanites and the Negroes we have the definite word of the Lord Himself that he placed a dark skin upon them as a curse \u2013 as a punishment and as a sign to all others. He forbade intermarriage with them under the threat of extension of the curse. (2 Nephi 5:21) And He certainly segregated the Negro as to the Priesthood, and drew an absolute line. You may even say He dropped an Iron curtain there. The Negro was cursed as to the Priesthood, and therefore, was cursed as to the blessings of the Priesthood. Certainly God made a segregation there.</p> <p> </p> <p>In spite of all he did in the pre-existent life, the Lord is willing, if the Negro accepts the gospel with real, sincere faith, and is really converted, to give him the blessings of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. If that Negro is faithful all his days, he can and will enter the celestial kingdom. He will go there as a servant, but he will get a celestial resurrection. He will get a place in the celestial glory. He will not go then with even the honorable men of the earth to the terrestrial glory, nor with the ones spoken of as being without law.</p> <p> </p> <p>*If I were to marry a Negro woman and have children by her, my children would all be cursed as to the priesthood. Do I want my children cursed as to the priesthood? If there is one drop of Negro blood in my children, as I read to you, they receive the curse. There isn\u2019t any argument, therefore, as to inter-marriage with the Negro, is there?</p> <p> </p> <p>Now we are generous with the Negro. We are willing that the Negro have the highest kind of education. I would be willing to let every Negro drive a Cadillac if they could afford it. I would be willing that they have all the advantages they can get out of life in the world. But let them enjoy these things among themselves. I think the Lord segregated the Negro and who is man to change that segregation?

All I can say is however well intended the explanations were, I think almost all of them were inadequate and/or wrong. \u2026 It probably would have been advantageous to say nothing, to say we just don\u2019t know, and, [as] with many religious matters, whatever was being done was done on the basis of faith at that time. But some explanations were given and had been given for a lot of years. \u2026 At the very least, there should be no effort to perpetuate those efforts to explain why that doctrine existed. I think, to the extent that I know anything about it, as one of the newer and younger ones to come along, \u2026 we simply do not know why that practice, that policy, that doctrine was in place. Well, some of the folklore that you must be referring to are suggestions that there were decisions made in the pre-mortal councils where someone had not been as decisive in their loyalty to a Gospel plan or the procedures on earth or what was to unfold in mortality, and that therefore that opportunity and mortality was compromised. I really don\u2019t know a lot of the details of those, because fortunately I\u2019ve been able to live in the period where we\u2019re not expressing or teaching them, but I think that\u2019s the one I grew up hearing the most, was that it was something to do with the pre-mortal councils. \u2026 But I think that\u2019s the part that must never be taught until anybody knows a lot more than I know. \u2026 We just don\u2019t know, in the historical context of the time, why it was practiced. \u2026 That\u2019s my principal [concern], is that we don\u2019t perpetuate explanations about things we don\u2019t know. \u2026We don\u2019t pretend that something wasn\u2019t taught or practice wasn\u2019t pursued for whatever reason. But I think we can be unequivocal and we can be declarative in our current literature, in books that we reproduce, in teachings that go forward, whatever, that from this time forward, from 1978 forward, we can make sure that nothing of that is declared. That may be where we still need to make sure that we\u2019re absolutely dutiful, that we put [a] careful eye of scrutiny on anything from earlier writings and teachings, just [to] make sure that that\u2019s not perpetuated in the present.

In a summary of their research, Wayment and his research assistant wrote:</p> <p>*Our research has revealed that the number of direct parallels between Smith\u2019s translation and Adam Clarke\u2019s biblical commentary are simply too numerous and explicit to posit happenstance or coincidental overlap. The parallels between the two texts number into the hundreds, a number that is well beyond the limits of this paper to discuss. A few of them, however, demonstrate Smith\u2019s open reliance upon Clarke and establish that he was inclined to lean on Clarke\u2019s commentary for matters of history, textual questions, clarification of wording, and theological nuance. In presenting the evidence, we have attempted to both establish that Smith drew upon Clarke, likely at the urging of Rigdon, and we present here a broad categorization of the types of changes that Smith made when he used Clarke as a source.</p> <p>\u2014 Did Adam Clarke's Bible Commentary significantly influence the JST?; see also a short summary at BYU, A Recently Recovered Source: Rethinking Joseph Smith\u2019s Bible Translation</p> <p> </p> <p>FAIR then quotes the following from a faith-positive podcast called LDS Perspectives, where Thomas Wayment is interviewed on this topic.

They\u2019re verbatim. Some of them are 5 to 6 words; some of them are 2 words; some of them are a single word. But in cases where that single word is fairly unique or different, it seemed pretty obvious that he\u2019s getting this from Adam Clarke. What really changed my worldview here is now I\u2019m looking at what appears obvious as a text person, that the prophet has used Adam Clarke. That in the process of doing the translation, he\u2019s either read it, has it in front of him, or he reads it at night. We started to look back through the Joseph Smith History. There\u2019s a story of his brother-in-law presenting Joseph Smith with a copy of Adam Clarke. We do not know whose copy of Adam Clarke it is, but we do know that Nathaniel Lewis gives it to the prophet and says, \"I want to use the Urim and Thummim. I want to translate some of the strange characters out of Adam Clarke\u2019s commentary.\" Joseph will clearly not give him the Urim and Thummim to do that, but we know he had it in his hands. Now looking at the text, we can say that a lot of the material that happens after Genesis 24. There are no parallels to Clarke between Genesis 1\u2013Genesis 24. But when we start to get to Matthew, it\u2019s very clear that Adam Clarke has influenced the way he changes the Bible. It was a big moment. That article comes out in the next year.

Nephi provokes his older brothers by preaching to them, and so L&amp;L \"did bind me with cords.\" Nephi, unable to do works on his own in this bound state, prayed unto the Lord for strength to burst these bands. The response is that \"the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet,\" answering Nephi's prayer in an indirect way, not as requested. In this example, God's hand in redemption is what makes the difference. God just grants Nephi freedom from bondage without requiring any kind of works or actions at all. In fact, Nephi had asked explicitly to be empowered to perform acts to free himself, but instead, his bindings were simply loosed. There's no room for misinterpretation, nor for Nephi to second guess that maybe he actually had done this himself, or that he was granted the strength to burst these bands as he prayed for the capacity to do. Nephi was freed from bondage solely by the grace of God, and God wanted to make sure that Nephi knew that.</p> <p>This is a strange observation compared to Nephi being later commanded to build a ship, and saying \"I've got no tools, tell me where to get ore so I can make tools so I can do what you asked.\" In that example of a technological anachronism, God was very hands-off, letting Nephi do all the manual labor as his brothers were \"desirous that they might not labor\".

Go look.</p> <p>Now... Imagine, ostensibly, twice that size seeing how ~2 million \"mighty men\" on one side of the conflict had died. Imagine that many people, each one engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and completely vanishing with no archaeological trace whatsoever.</p> <p> </p> <p>Folks who appreciate sports more than I do might be interested in a crowd of approximately four million in Buenos Aires, Argentina in celebration of the 2022 World Cup victory.

Then imagine that number of deceased soldiers just disappearing.</p> <p> </p> <p>I don't know what's a non-violent idiom to use in place of \"beating a dead horse\", but I recognize that I'm belaboring this point.

Exact numbers aren't explicit, but the invading forces under Mordor number from 18,000 + to tens of thousands. I don't know what's a reasonable estimation. Thirty thousand, maybe? How many tens of thousands would you guesstimate to be visible in the above image? Arguably a smaller number than two million.</p> <p>If I were to generously round up the Battle of the Pelennor Fields' invading forces to be fifty thousand, we'd have to conclude that the Book of Mormon depicts a battle with casualties deaths <code>2,000,000/50,000 = 40</code> times larger.</p> <p>How big of an army would you need to end two million lives? 2.1 million? Don't forget that since this is a big number that my lizard-brain doesn't like, just adding that decimal for a numeric advantage is one hundred thousand additional soldiers; twice that of an arbitrary guesstimation of Minas Tirith's invading force. Two million died on one side. How many died on the other side? Assuming they were comparably matched, this means we should see a battlefield with ostensibly four million corpses of fallen soldiers.</p> <p>Yet there is not one scrap of evidence to be found.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Scripture/Book%20of%20Mormon/Jaredites/#ww1","title":"WW1","text":"<p>Let\u2019s compare that to battle deaths on the western front in the First World War.

If we narrow down our scope to the Battle of Verdun, we're looking at <code>715,000 - 755,000</code> casualties spanning nearly ten months. The above passage in Ether doesn't explicitly outline a time frame for the two million deaths. Maybe it was over eight years? I have no way of knowing. I do feel confident that the Jaredites didn't have M1919 Browning .30 caliber automatic machine guns mounted on jeeps, and so in order to kill two million, it will necessarily take longer than World War 1's western front.</p> <p>Actually, you know what\u2014 six to seven million, as estimated by the mighty men plus wives plus children, is a number that has a pretty direct comparison to the number of Jewish people killed during the holocaust. To be clear, the only comparison I'm making here is the number of deaths, no further implications other than scale. Imagine numerous deaths on the scale of the 1940's holocaust, possibly greater, A) happening around 580 BCE, and B) just... poofing away. No mass graves to be found.</p> <p>The idea that a bronze age civilization would be capable of inflicting death on a holocaust scale and then leaving absolutely no trace is patently absurd.

I can assume they have archery technology, given that archaeologists can find arrowheads from 70,000 years ago (but no traces of ancient American holocaust-scale mass deaths.)

It would take you hours to walk the distance of a quarter-mile.</p> <p>Do you see a logistical problem here? If your battalion is greater than, say, three hundred people, the fight is going to be akin to waiting in line for there to be a large enough gap for you to even swing your weapon.

We're presenting bias to lead to a determined conclusion without enough information. This verse describes three things (again, before we even see a name):</p> <ol> <li>He came into Zerahemla</li> <li>He's bad and evil</li> <li>He preached against the prophecies about Christ</li> </ol> <p>Remember that, now.

No law saying you have to believe this thing or that... because of this Bible passage. This will also become relevant later. Don't worry about how we're ~525 years displaced from Lehi leaving Jerusalem with the Plates of Brass\u2014that exact phrasing from around 14th century B.C.E. was preserved across centuries and its interpretation is solid enough to base laws off of.</p> <p> </p> <p>Verse 9 describes belief in God as a privilege. I find that to be a curious choice of words, as a privilege suggests (to me) that it can be revoked. I wonder if other religious teachings are presented as being a privilege?</p> <p>Verses 10 &amp; 11 are a short tangent describing how laws exist, and breaking laws results in punishments in case that wasn't self-evident. Don't forget that this record is an abridgement etched by hand onto metal plates, and only the most critical factors have been distilled into this text we read today. It's vital that you understand that this civilization doesn't like murder or robbery. That's what really sets it apart from contemporary cultures.</p> <p> </p> <p>12 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying...</p> <p>In case you forgot from the brief tangent explaining natural law, we'll now remind you for a second time that this man is Antichrist. After this second reminder, we finally get his name. Have we made it evident yet that he's bad and evil? Before sharing any direct quotes, topics, or summaries, you need to understand that he is bad.</p> <p>We've also reminded you once again that the law has nothing against Korihor teaching his perspective. That must be an important detail.</p> <p> </p> <p>13 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why do ye look for a Christ? For no man can know of anything which is to come.</p> <p>14 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers.</p> <p>15 How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.</p> <p>Let's take a moment to zoom out\u2014we're reading Alma chapter 30. Any Mormon who had been paying attention in Seminary could remind you that only two chapters later, Alma the Younger advises us that faith is not knowledge (1, 2, 3).</p> <p>That said, what I understand Korihor to be saying here is \"there isn't tangible evidence of Christ. You don't know He's coming. This is a tradition that you should give critical evaluation to.\"</p> <p>Assuming that assessment is correct, tell me what Korihor is saying wrong? Is he lying? Is he misleading people? It sure sounds to me like he's challenging claims of knowledge, as these people in Zerahemla seem to have conflated belief with knowledge. He's saying \"you don't know this.\" Two chapters later, Alma agrees by very clearly differentiating faith from knowledge, and Korihor's audience has faith in Christ.</p> <p> </p> <p>17 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.</p> <p>Examining one's worldview from an outside perspective is a good way to evaluate them\u2014 at minimum, it can help you practice how to articulate or defend your beliefs. Ideally, it would grant you some empathy for an outsider and their confusion over your dogma.</p> <p>Think of this theology from the perspective of an outsider like Korihor. \"You believe that sins a) exist, b) will cause you to suffer for all eternity after you die, unless c) must be atoned for by someone who isn't born yet. Not one of these things can be demonstrably proven. You don't know any of this to be true, it sure sounds like a foolish tradition passed down by your ancestors. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Have you taken time to stop and consider that possibility?\"</p> <p>Faring by consequence of self-management &amp; prospering according to ones genius seems reasonable. Those things are more tangible. Life isn't always so simple, but we could forgive an entry-level philosophy student for landing on that conclusion. An atonement isn't needed if sin doesn't exist. If Korihor's audience were to stop framing things as sins, this purported savior wouldn't be necessary, either.</p> <p>\"Whatsoever a man did was no crime\" at face value sounds like it's a contrast to the earlier verses outlining laws and punishments. Looking a bit deeper might mean that on a grander scale, actions that we mortals take in our day-to-day lives will have no impact on the world, galaxy, universe, not tomorrow nor a thousand years from now. It sounds like nihilistic fatalism.</p> <p> </p> <p>18 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms\u2014telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.</p> <p>Oh, no, not whoredoms!</p> <p>So...

The chapter I'm reading from is 60 verses long, you can read the original text if you choose to.</p> <p> </p> <p>19-20: Korihor goes to Jershon, the home of former Lamanites who made a pact of pacifism. Korihor's preaching is met by being tied up, and taken to the high priest named Ammon. These people \"were more wise than many of the Nephites.\"</p> <p>\"See, the smart people tied up Korihor and took him to the high priest. That was the wise thing to do about a guy who isn't breaking any laws  concerning beliefs. They're smarter than the Nephites in Zerahemla.\"</p> <p>right okay</p> <p> </p> <p>21: Jershon's residents send Korihor away, so he tries again in a place called Gideon. Korihor is met with the same treatment\u2014 rejection, and being arrested and taken to the high priest.</p> <p>Remember when we established that \"the law could have no hold on him?\" Or that there was \"no law against a man\u2019s belief\"? I honestly don't know how to settle that idea with the fact that the chief judge can banish someone from the land after people tied up Korihor to force him to face judgment. I really don't. Judgment for what? It must not have been for preaching a different belief, we've established twice that this wasn't against any laws!</p> <p> </p> <p>22-23: The high priest Giddonah begins examining Korihor. Korihor's explanation for his arrest is \"because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by ancient priests.\"</p> <p>Korihor continues in the next few verses, quoted here:</p> <p>24 Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</p> <p>25 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</p> <p>26 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain for the sins of the world[.]</p> <p>Text doesn't communicate tone very well. You could read this as a sniveling, sneering villain, accusing God's infallible ideology of being nonsensical, or you could read this as an explanation. Imagine Giddonah asking \"Why are you here? What did you do to upset people?\" \"I'm here because I don't believe the things you do, and I think your following is conflating belief with knowledge.\" </p> <p>Korihor is not even rejecting or denying the existing cultural teachings. Re-read verse 24\u2014 he isn't saying \"your prophecies are false,\" he's saying \"you do not know that they are true.\"</p> <p>When Korihor makes his case, count how many times \"because\" appears in his explanation\u2014 for it is exactly that, an explanation. Korihor's words are inflammatory, yes, but I should hope that the chief judge and high priest Giddonah could see it objectively and not take personal offense. \"Your people tied me up and brought me to you for judgment when I've not broken any laws. Here's what I told them.\" He's probably feeling a bit grumpy about it. I would be.</p> <p>Let's not stray too far from verse 25 before emphasizing the central point inside. Korihor is saying that people shouldn't be punished for their parents' transgressions. Where have I heard that idea before? That's one of the articles of faith, written by our founding prophet Joseph Smith. Is Korihor wrong to point out accountability as taught by God's true church?</p> <p> </p> <p>28: Korihor observes that Nephites could \"offend some unknown being, who they say is God\u2014a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.\" I suppose this is the moment where Korihor is getting too fired up about being tied down and brought to a chief judge over a law he didn't break, explaining to a high priest his beliefs counter to the common religion.</p> <p> </p> <p>29 Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.</p> <p>Well what the fuck.</p> <p></p> <p>Silent treatment, getting bound up again and escalated to the governor over all the land. By the way, there is no law against a man's belief.</p> <p> </p> <p>30 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.</p> <p>31 And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.</p> <p>Yeah I bet Korihor is getting quite impatient. He's observing that this group of people has conflated belief with knowledge, and has been met with getting arrested and forcibly brought before law enforcement for the third time now.</p> <p>Quick side note: Verse 30 says Korihor is blaspheming.</p> <p>[Blasphemy] generally denotes contemptuous speech concerning God or concerning something that stands in a sacred relation toward God, such as His temple, His law, or His prophet.</p> <p>...</p> <p>The punishment for willful and intentional blasphemy was death by stoning. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which is willfully denying Christ after having received a perfect knowledge of Him from the Holy Ghost, is the unforgivable sin.</p> <p>\u2014 Blasphemy, Bible Dictionary; see also Guide to the Scriptures</p> <p>Boy, good thing these Nephites in the \ud83e\udd85 land of the free \ud83c\udf86 and \ud83c\udf54 home of the brave \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 don't have these kinds of laws, or Korihor's tale would have ended by now. Instead, he's just saying something contemptuous (disrespectful) about a state religion.</p> <p>\"You've said something disrespectful of an intangible being whom we have no laws concerning, and who cannot be demonstrably proven to exist? HOW DARE YOU we're taking you to the judges for not breaking the law we have in place to protect you from this exact scenario\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Verses 32 - 34 contain Alma's rebuttal, defending himself that Alma doesn't get paid for this clerical work. Note that in 31, Korihor spoke before Alma, \"[reviling] against the priests and teachers,\" and Alma takes it personally. It doesn't sound to me like it was directed at Alma specifically, but okay. Korihor has said that priests broadly are \"glutting on the labors of the people.\" I might take that to mean that the church demands a lot of unpaid volunteer labor of the people?

Is the perception that this otherworldly messenger telling Korihor to leave a false God, and return to a true God? That would make more sense. Korihor's perspective would then be \"I have seen (what I believe to be) an angel of God, who has charged me to preach in your land. I opted to do this by observing that you Nephites have conflated belief and knowledge, thereby I intend to inspire critical thinking to change your misplaced beliefs.\"</p> <p>Irrespective of my extrapolated assumption, an angel appearing is a very compelling defense. An angel appeared to Alma several chapters back, and Alma took that angel's words at face value. Korihor did the same thing, and gets shit on for believing an angel! Who are the good guys in this story?</p> <p>In today's LDS church, we have modern revelation about \"the devil [appearing] as an angel of light.\" If I am to believe that the modern LDS church is a restoration of God's one true church, and that this is the same church that Korihor is criticizing and that Alma is defending, I should expect that same doctrine of an unchanging, eternal God would be present in Alma's time. Alma advises Korihor about the words of prophets written on scriptural records. I should hope that they have the awareness of the same doctrines that Joseph Smith had when D&amp;C 129 was recorded. The section heading doesn't state that this is revelation from the Lord, but it is in a book of scripture nonetheless.</p> <p>4 When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.</p> <p>5 If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.</p> <p>6 If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear\u2014</p> <p>7 Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.</p> <p>8 If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.</p> <p>\u2014 D&amp;C 129:4-8</p> <p>But for whatever reason, Korihor did not extend his hand to the angel. Because he's not part of the church? Though he did recognize the angel for being a representative of a divine ruler. When Alma presented scriptures as a convincing testimony of God to Korihor, was this the first Korihor had encountered scriptures? If so, Korihor was completely blindsided by this angel, not being aware of God, nor that an angel could be a disguised devil, making Korihor all the more deserving of forgiveness. Could Korihor's experience be compared, even tangentially, to Joseph's First Vision? He had heavenly messengers appear. That doesn't happen to anyone, and would explain his conviction.</p> <p>He must have been aware of scriptures. If Korihor saw an angel purporting to represent God, that wouldn't mean much if Korihor wasn't aware of God\u2014 not to mention Korihor later stating that \"I always knew.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>54 Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the\u00a0curse\u00a0might be taken from him.</p> <p>55 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.</p> <p>K, in writing: Straight up, I cannot verbally pray. You seem pretty qualified to do that. Will you pray to God to lift this curse? If it means anything to you, I wouldn't ask you to do this if I didn't think it would work. I'm feeling pretty confident that this is something that only God could do.</p> <p>A: lol. lmao. You want forgiveness? That's not how we do things in the theology centered around Jesus Christ's return to atone for sins and grant forgiveness. If I forgave you, you'd just go back to being a lying little shit-ass. I do not believe that you, Korihor, have the capacity to learn from mistakes and grow as a person. Also, don't ask anyone about my conversion story, how I was forgiven for doing exactly what you are doing right now. Get out of my office.</p> <p>56 And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of\u00a0Korihor; but he was\u00a0cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.</p> <p>so... what the fuck.</p> <p>This is Alma the Younger. You know, the one who had a notorious conversion story, going from actively seeking to destroy the church of God to having an angel deliver a verbal smackdown and straighten him out? The same Alma who was struck dumb by the power of God for stealing away the hearts of the people, causing much dissention? That guy?</p> <p>Of any person for Korihor to interact with, I would hope that Alma, of all people, would be empathetic and compassionate, seeing how Korihor is doing the exact same fucking thing that Alma did, continuing up until divine intervention shook him into sobriety. What am I supposed to learn from this story?</p> <p>Shifting our focus away from Alma being a real bitch-and-a-half about all of this, Korihor is now destitute, starving and begging for food. Presumably homeless, seeing how he entered Zerahemla from somewhere outside of its borders. Jesus Christ had some select words for those who refused to help the impoverished, the hungry, the destitute. That was kind of His whole deal in the New Testament. Jesus had gained quite a reputation for caring about poor people (1, 2, 3). This is a golden opportunity for the followers of Jesus Christ's teachings to take in Korihor and show him charity and compassion. Do any of Christ's followers do that here?</p> <p> </p> <p>57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto\u00a0Korihor\u00a0was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of\u00a0Korihor\u00a0that they must speedily repent,\u00a0lest\u00a0the same judgments would come unto them.</p> <p>Alma: YEAH I'LL DO IT TO YOU ALL TOO UNLESS YOU GET IN LINE. by the way there is no law against a man\u2019s belief \ud83d\ude07</p> <p> </p> <p>58 And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of\u00a0Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of\u00a0Korihor. And\u00a0Korihor\u00a0did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.</p> <p>Everyone else who Korihor talked to gets forgiven for believing Korihor's words. Korihor, on the other hand, believed an angel, gets fucked over sideways, and is not forgiven even after committing to change? Very cool, very Christlike. \ud83d\udc4d</p> <p>There is no law against a man's belief (in case that hasn't been made abundantly clear by now,) but we have Alma threatening \"all the people in the land\" with the same punishment that befell Korihor if anyone \"had believed in the words of Korihor[.]\" On what grounds? There isn't a law! What the hell is happening? </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>59 And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves\u00a0Zoramites, being\u00a0led by a man whose name was Zoram\u2014and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was\u00a0dead.</p> <p>What the fuck</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Scripture/Book%20of%20Mormon/Korihor/#the-moral-of-the-story","title":"The Moral of the Story","text":"<p>60 And thus we see the end of him who\u00a0perverteth\u00a0the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not\u00a0support\u00a0his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to\u00a0hell.</p> <p>The...

Rather than copy a list here, I'll point you to the LDS scriptural topical guide entry, outlining martyrdom in the Book of Mormon, the index of the triple combination on martyrdom, and the guide to the scriptures references. The translator of this record, Joseph Smith himself, gets martyred, and... well, whether Joseph was perverting the ways of the Lord is an issue too big to tackle here. Thus we see that Korihor is the exception here. The moral of this story is that you're going to get screwed over by a divine power, irrespective of which one you follow. Thus we see Alma being a dickwad and refusing to forgive someone who did exactly what he did years prior. Thus we see the prophet denying someone salvation because his feelings got hurt, because he was accused of getting rich, and because Korihor delineated faith vs knowledge.</p> <p>Thus we see that you don't dare question authority.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Scripture/Book%20of%20Mormon/Korihor/#tie-up-loose-ends","title":"Tie up loose ends","text":"<p>If you'd read this entire page of notes, you might recall way at the beginning of Korihor's introduction the example of poisoning the well, where before we even know who he is, we're told he's an antichrist, and is not to be trusted.

Was he wicked? In contrast, we can demonstrate that Alma was wicked at one point.</p> <p>Re-read this chapter, but skip verses 6, 12, and 60. Doing that will remove the passages calling Korihor an Antichrist, and doesn't wrap it all up with the moral lesson at the end.

He gets rejected, persecuted for his beliefs, bound and brought before law enforcement, eventually cursed by the god of these people, and he gets trampled to death for it all. If we don't frame it in the context of \"this guy is a Snidely Whiplash-style cartoonish villain,\" this is a tragic story of someone who is just trying their best to follow their religious convictions.

The original text is unbroken. It's a bit lengthy!</p> Joseph Smith Senior's Dream <p>In 1811, we moved from Royalton, Vermont, to the town of Lebanon, New Hampshire. Soon after arriving here, my husband received another very singular vision, which I will relate:\u2014</p> <p>\"I thought,\" said he, \"I was traveling in an open, desolate field, which appeared to be very barren. As I was thus traveling, the thought suddenly came into my mind that I had better stop and reflect upon what I was doing, before I went any further. So I asked myself, 'What motive can I have in traveling here, and what place can this be?' My guide, who was by my side, as before, said, 'This is the desolate world; but travel on.'</p> <p>The road was so broad and barren, that I wondered why I should travel in it; for, said I to myself, 'Broad is the road, and wide is the gate that leads to death, and many there be that walk therein; but narrow is the way, and strait is the gate that leads to everlasting life, and few there be that go in thereat.' Traveling a short distance further, I came to a narrow path.</p> <p>This path I entered, and, when I had traveled a little way in it, I beheld a beautiful stream of water, which ran from the east to the west. Of this stream, I could see neither the source nor yet the mouth; but as far as my eyes could extend I could see a rope, running along the bank of it, about as high as a man could reach, and beyond me, was a low, but very pleasant valley, in which stood a tree, such as I had never seen before. It was exceedingly handsome, insomuch that I looked upon it with wonder and admiration. Its beautiful branches spread themselves somewhat like an umbrella, and it bore a kind of fruit, in shape much like a chestnut bur, and as white as snow, or, if possible, whiter. </p> <p>I gazed upon the same with considerable interest, and as I was doing so, the burs or shells commenced opening and shedding their particles, or the fruit which they contained, which was of dazzling whiteness. I drew near, and began to eat of it, and I found it delicious beyond description. As I was eating, I said in my heart, 'I cannot eat this alone, I must bring my wife and children, that they may partake with me.' Accordingly, I went and brought my family, which consisted of a wife and seven children, and we all commenced eating, and praising God for this blessing. We were exceedingly happy, insomuch that our joy could not easily be expressed.</p> <p>While thus engaged, I beheld a spacious building standing opposite the valley which we were in, and it appeared to reach to the very heavens. It was full of doors and windows, and they were all filled with people, who were very finely dressed. When these people observed us in the low valley, under the tree, they pointed the finger of scorn at us, and treated us with all manner of disrespect and contempt. But their contumely we utterly disregarded. I presently turned to my guide, and inquired of him the meaning of the fruit that was so delicious. He told me it was the pure love of God, shed abroad in the hearts of all those who love him, and keep his commandments.</p> <p>He then commanded me to go and bring the rest of my children. I told him that we were all there. 'No,' he replied, 'look yonder, you have two more, and you must bring them also.' Upon raising my eyes, I saw two small children, standing some distance off. I immediately went to them, and brought them to the tree; upon which they commenced eating with the rest, and we all rejoiced together. The more we ate, the more we seemed to desire, until we even got down upon our knees, and scooped it up, eating it by double handfulls.</p> <p>After feasting in this manner a short time, I asked my guide what was the meaning of the spacious building which I saw. He replied, 'It is Babylon, it is Babylon, and it must fall. The people in the doors and windows are the inhabitants thereof, who scorn and despise the Saints of God, because of their humility.' I soon awoke, clapping my hands together for joy.\"</p> <p>There exists a trope for fabricated stories to end with \"and then everyone stood up and clapped,\" but, uh...

Of this stream, I could see neither the source nor yet the mouth[.] 8:13And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the fruit. A rope running along the bank of the river (functionally identical to the rod of iron Lehi's account) as far as my eyes could extend I could see a rope, running along the bank of it, about as high as a man could reach[.] 8:19And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.8:24And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron.

Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen. Joseph, Sr. desires that his family should partake of the fruit also As I was eating, I said in my heart, 'I cannot eat this alone, I must bring my wife and children, that they may partake with me.' Accordingly, I went and brought my family ... and we all commenced eating, and praising God for this blessing. 8:12And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. A spacious building filled with people who are mocking those who eat the fruit I beheld a spacious building standing opposite the valley which we were in, and it appeared to reach to the very heavens. It was full of doors and windows, and they were all filled with people, who were very finely dressed. 8:26-2726 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit. Joseph, Sr. and his family ignore the mocking When these people observed us in the low valley, under the tree, they pointed the finger of scorn at us, and treated us with all manner of disrespect and contempt.

Consider how many sheep it would take to get the fabric for the sails and rope. Consider how any human alive today could build something, anything, from scratch. Not buying supplies from Home Depot, not buying components from another retailer. Imagine you, your hands, and the world, being told to make... a skateboard. Something pedestrian. Could you? Even if you knew how, you would be relying on knowledge, innovation and cooperation from other humans. Can you make a tree into a 2x4 length of wood on your own? In theory, yes, given the tools. Could you do it with no tools? Could anyone do it with no tools?</p> <p>For Lehi and his family to travel to the promised land from Jerusalem, they necessarily had to travel by sea. What led them to the coast was a Liahona, of curious craftsmanship, that just appeared when they woke up one morning. Other precedents for guiding people like, say, Israelites with Moses in the wilderness, had guidance more like pillars of cloud or fire. I guess Lehi gets a compass. A conditional compass, no less. No parallels to 19th century right-hand path magic.</p> <p>If God can do whatever he wants, he could have just as easily had Lehi's family wake up and find a boat ready to go. Or, better yet, they simply wake up in Peru. Those are non-falsifiable claims. Could have happened, and we would only be able to marvel at how great God is for being both able and willing to do that. Instead, we have a scriptural account of Nephi being commanded to build a boat. This can be read as a faith-promoting story about God giving us accountability to take matters into our own hands. However, we're also given a timeline for when this is purported to have happened, and that is where problems arise.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Scripture/Book%20of%20Mormon/Seafaring/#we-need-tools","title":"We need tools!","text":"<p>The setup for this tale is that Lehi's family is wandering in the wilderness for eight years. Presumably that includes the times they had to go back to Jerusalem for plates, then again for wives. I'll repeat again for emphasis, eight years. In my limited experience of camping, for never more than one week at a time, I find myself very skeptical of the utility of their equipment and supplies. The context for Lehi's story is that they have nothing. Either it would have worn down, been destroyed, or simply discarded as dead weight. Did they leave Jerusalem with a pickaxe? If they did, is it in usable condition after eight years? Wouldn't someone by year five have thought \"what am I hauling this around for?\" Am I safe to assume that they didn't expect to need a pickaxe at this promised land that God is leading them to? Did God warn Lehi to pack one ahead of time? Is that a detail from the 116 pages?</p> <p>All they know is that Lehi is being led to a promised land. I'll assume that in 600 BC, Jaffa (the location of modern-day Tel Aviv) had enough local renown for Lehi to at least know that it's a coastal settlement. Since Lehi isn't told at the outset to travel northwest, I imagine that the family expected that the promised land wouldn't require seafaring, but that they could simply walk to it provided they had divine guidance. Traveling by foot to Jaffa from Jerusalem would be around 16 hours of walking; I wouldn't expect to do that in one day with a caravan, but I imagine it could be done in under one week.</p> <p>Fast forward several years, they get to a land which is not the promised land, and they call it Bountiful \"because of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were prepared of the Lord that we might not perish.\" Verses 7-8: After being in Bountiful for several days, Nephi is told to build a ship. Verse 9 is important: </p> <p>9 And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?</p> <p>10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools.</p> <p>\"Alright,\" says Nephi. \"If I'm to follow this commandment, I need tools. God, tell me where to find materials to make tools.\"</p> <p>Nephi wouldn't need to make tools if he had brought tools. Those two verses suggest pretty strongly that Nephi does not have the tools he needs to build a ship\u2014 thus, he is asking where to find ore to make tools. Fortunately for our attention spans, the scriptures don't make an exhaustive list of each tool needed and used. The drawback to that absence is that we're left to speculate on how did Nephi get the ore after God led him to it.</p> <p>11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I had made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together that I might make fire.</p> <p>16 And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I did molten out of the rock.</p> <p>It's not explicitly stated what ore this is, but we can rule out some possibilities since it's a transoceanic vessel, to be submerged in saltwater for an extended amount of time. Gold, silver, or copper won't do. Iron will do, though. Can we assume it's iron? It's not likely to be any kind of alloy like bronze\u2014 that would add an extra dimension of complication to an already dubious story.</p> <p>Nephi didn't respond by saying \"oh, that's why you had us bring a wagon full of tools from Jerusalem! I was wondering why I'd need smithing tongs, bow saws, pulley blocks &amp; sheaves, and a pickaxe. Wise as ever, Jesus!\" Instead, Nephi asserts \"I need to create tools that are required to do this job that you asked me to do.\" So, imagine Nephi on this mountain, and he is told that there is iron here. How is he going to get the iron out of the mountain? I feel pretty confident that at this point Nephi doesn't have any tools. He has a bellows at this point somehow, so that's one item off of the checklist. He know he needs tools to build the boat, and we know he needs tools to get the iron to make the tools to build the boat. How do you mine iron out of a mountain without tools?</p> <p>The iron isn't exposed to the elements in a seam, like an exposed vein, since verse 16 explicitly states that Nephi used \"the ore which I did molten out of the rock.\" He also says \"molten\" back in verse 9. In English, the language to which the Book of Mormon was perfectly translated to, molten means to melt iron. This means that Nephi needs a blast furnace. The iron has to be heat treated.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Scripture/Book%20of%20Mormon/Seafaring/#metallurgy","title":"Metallurgy","text":"<p>Contemporary technology around 591 BC used a type of furnace called a bloomery. It was capable of making iron soft, but not molten. Amateur-grade metallurgy that you or I could reproduce in our own backyard, like simply burning wood for a homemade pizza oven, could reach a range of 500 to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That's almost hot enough to melt aluminum. Nephi likely didn't make aluminum tools. Nephi would need a furnace to get up to 2,000 degrees to make iron soft, and up to 3,000F degrees to make it molten... in 591 BC. The technology to do that would not exist for another 1,500 years, around 1,100 AD (1, 2). For reference, here are some melting points of various metals. Making these ores molten, as verse 16 explicitly states, would require Nephi to be able to implement heat that would be unheard of in that century.</p> <p>Simply having the blast furnace isn't quite enough, either. Nephi needs fuel to burn. The most useful fuel source in the Sinai Peninsula around 591 BC would be charcoal. That will only get us up to, again, about 1,000 degrees. Humanity couldn't get 3,000 degree furnaces until we started burning coal (not charcoal,) which is not available in the Sinai Peninsula around 590 BC. For the quantities of charcoal they would need, Nephi would have had to deforest aces and acres and acres of woodlands. Nephi's brethren were \"desirous that they might not labor\", so we could assume that they weren't helping prepare the wood. Who was chopping the wood? Just to make the charcoal, not counting lumber to build the boat itself. Just the fuel for the furnace, Nephi needs inordinate quantities of charcoal to get the furnace hot enough to build the pickaxe that he needs to get the iron out of the mountain in order to make the tools to build a ship.

Today, a manufacturer can buy volumes of nails/screws, so you can do the assembly. This is relevant to this Book of Mormon passage because Nephi had to create an entire smithy from nothing. That is not impossible, but is absurdly unlikely given the technology in that century. For every piece of timber with which he's making the ship, he'll ostensibly need nails to fix the wood together. And let's not forget that it can't be just any old species of tree\u2014 specific varieties and grades of wood are suitable for seafaring. Your ship's mast can't be just any old tree, either. You'll need a very long, straight pine tree.</p> <p>Manufacturing nails after the industrial revolution is trivial to do on a mass-production scale. Doing it by hand in 590 BC would take a prohibitively long duration of time, burning through the forest to fuel the fire to manipulate the iron to make the nails. Don't forget that it's a seafaring ship, Nephi will need thousands of them, and he has to make each individual one by hand (using tongs,) seeing how his brothers were desirous that they might not labor. Is this impossible? No, it's just absurd and unlikely, and at this point it might take Nephi ten years to single-handedly establish his own industry around charcoal and smithing. Did Nephi bring iron tongs from Jerusalem? I assume not, having needed to obtain iron before he could make tools.</p> <p>Another example of that absurdity is Nephi using bellows for the furnace, be it a bloomery or blast furnace. Did they find wildlife in Bountiful to hunt, skin, and tan leather from? Did they bring sheep with them over the desert for eight years? Did they have a supply of leather on them?

Seeing how he needed to obtain ore (material) to create tools, I think it's safe to assume that Nephi did not have all the materials handy.</p> <p>If you're beginning to question how in the hell did Nephi do all of this by today's understanding of what a ship is, we've got that covered\u2014 in 1 Ne 18:2, Nephi was very clear that \"I built a ship, but it wasn't done how regular folks build ships, this was from God so it was different so don't worry about it.\" Because, having grown up in Jerusalem, he has a vivid frame of reference for how ships were built \"after the manner of men,\" I guess. The \"manner of men\" shipwrights have to heat-treat and steam the timbers so that they can be bent without breaking. I guess Nephi didn't do that? That would be pretty revolutionary technology, seeing how simply manufacturing a keel for a ship is a profession. Just the keel! Making timber watertight might require tar, resin, or some other kind of malleable sealant. Was that in their provisions in case of a leak?</p> <p>Without a dry dock, assuming Nephi built the ship on the shore, once it's done he'd need to rely on high tide to come in and lift the ship off the sand and pull it into the water, and hope that didn't happen once during the 9+ years it was under construction. Did he make a graving dry dock? You know, digging a big hole in the ground below the waterline for construction, with retractable gates to control the flow of water into the site to lift the ship? Was the dock sheltered from weather and elements? And he showed up with no tools? Did he molten a shovel and use that to keep seawater from seeping through the coastal sand? Or am I expected to believe that he made a slipway with rails or rollers that didn't damage the keel? I guess we won't know, seeing how it isn't \"after the manner of men.\"</p> <p>Did they have a tiller or a rudder? It could have been a stern-mounted oar that functions as a rudder. If that was the case, it would snap as soon as they hit stormy water. What we think of today as a rudder is attached to the sternpost, the skeleton of the ship, making them much more sturdy.

We also need ropes. Did they bring numerous spools of rope with them from Jerusalem? The scriptures don't explicitly say. Once out to sea, Nephi was \"bound with cords,\" though it's not explicitly stated as ropes. I'm having a hard time imagining what else they could be. Weaving ropes by hand must be how it was done before ropewalks existed, using machinery to weave and twist them together. That isn't unreasonable to do by hand, though it's going to add more hours to Nephi's nine-year construction process. </p> <p>Wool rope isn't good for seafaring as it will stretch out once it gets wet. Oceans are notorious for having lots of water, so that leaves Nephi with plant-based options like hemp or flax. Not only will he need several separate lengths, but ropes for sailing need to not only hold tensile strength when wet, but they need to be of a minimum diameter to keep the ship together. This isn't something to skimp out on, once the winds pick up out in the ocean, you need those ropes to hold fast. Making them thick and sturdy enough isn't a gentle, delicate process. Ships need a lot of strong rope to sail.</p> <p>By the way, unless this is another time when the Book of Mormon\u2014which was translated perfectly into English\u2014forgot what a word means, 1 Ne 18:9 says they \"been driven forth before the wind for the space of many days,\" verse 22 states that Nephi \"did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land.\" Having a sail that can be rotated and angled to catch wind will require lots and lots of rope.</p> <p>A sail also needs to be a very large sheet of very sturdy material. Longship sails were around 144 square feet (12m x 12m). Transoceanic sails were upwards of 100 square meters. Did Lehi pack one before leaving the imaginary seaports in Jerusalem? Or did they need to build looms and shear hundreds of sheep, and then keep it from rotting, keep it away from rodents? How many sheep would that require? I don't have numbers, but I have read that sheep can only be sheared once a year, so unless the sail was fabricated incrementally, we'd be looking at 200 concurrent sheep to create one sail. Are they going to need patches for if the sail tears? Are they going to have a backup sail?</p> <p>Assuming they even have sheep, they would either have had to bring a herd of fifty or more across the desert for eight years, or else happen to find sheep along the way, maybe already living in Bountiful. They need food and water, too. They have to be fenced in, pastured, tend to the young. Shepherding is also a full-time responsibility.</p> <p> </p> <p>Maybe I'm just hard-hearted.

Nephi had better technology, so I suppose if navigation was going to be handled by God, Nephi wouldn't have been given a compass, right? ... But Nephi does have a compass, and it's shown to be critical for the journey. So... is it safe to assume that Lehi &amp; friends will need oceanic navigation tools?</p> <p>To my uneducated eyes there is absolutely no way of knowing where in the world I am, when out at sea. The surface of the ocean has no visual landmarks, just water in every direction. Once nightfall arrives, stars are clearly visible, and could ostensibly be used for navigation to at least know that you haven't veered off course in the last hour or two. The sun predictably rises in the east, and sets in the west. I have now imparted to you all knowledge that I could use to intuit what to do if lost at sea. Maybe Nephi, growing up in ancient Jerusalem, knows more about oceanic navigation than I do, seeing how... you know, ancient Jerusalem was known for its busy seaports.</p> <p>Verse 9 describes this ship becoming a party boat. God is going to have none of that, particularly if L&amp;L are going to be mean to Nephi. Nevermind that the whole pretense of Lehi's family leaving Jerusalem to avoid destruction. God just allowed Jerusalem to be besieged by the Neo-Babylonian Empire, later burnt down and its temple destroyed\u2014 stay focused, now, we're not trying to make sense of God influencing the Liahona's functionality, just remember that speaking to Nephi with much rudeness upsets God a lot more than Babylonians desecrating the Temple. What the hell, God?</p> <p> </p> <p>Lehi has a compass. Curious workmanship. Don't worry about how compasses didn't exist for another 1,700 years, Lehi knew exactly what it was, how to use it, and fortunately, Reformed Egyptian\u2122\ufe0f has a word for it. One of two spindles points \"the way whither we should go.\" After L&amp;L have tied up Nephi with cords (again,) the Liahona stopped working. Since navigating at sea is surely more complicated than I realize, Nephi's brothers \"knew not whither they should steer the ship.\" A storm arises, and they \"were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days[.]\" </p> <p>This is notorious for a few reasons: among them, God doesn't seem to be influencing the wind at the sails for the ship\u2014 if He was, Lehi's family wouldn't need to know \"whither they should steer the ship.\" Even a passing curiosity about \"whither they should steer the ship\" indicates that Lehi's family is responsible for navigating. God is not steering Lehi's family like he did for the Jaredites' submersibles. They have a buoyant ship and a compass, and have to figure out the rest.</p> <p>The other notorious observation in this verse is... they only have a compass. How did they know that they were driven back for three days? All they have is a direction, contingent upon obedience. They have no charts, reference points, maps, no way to know once they shape up and the storm clears that they had lost three days of progress. Moreover, did a storm arise and diminish each time Nephi got his feelings hurt? If that happened, I would expect that L&amp;L could at least recognize a pattern\u2014 they've seen divine intervention up to this point, and mocking their brother (hypothetically) makes for undesirable sailing conditions.</p> <p>I don't know just how intense these storms were, but someone on the ship could justifiably think \"hell yeah, more wind at our backs! Full speed ahead,\" assuming they have no way to measure progress over distance. If they were in doldrums, they could simply be adrift with no wind for three days, I guess. They don't know where the promised land is, how far away it is, or even how fast they're moving\u2014 they only know \"it's that way.\" How would they know that the Liahona even stopped working, unless it's being constantly monitored for erratic behavior? If anyone said something unkind to Nephi, did they have to stop everything and evaluate? With no visual landmarks, amid a storm they wouldn't be able to see the stars. Unless it was spinning around indecipherably, the wrong direction could be easily misinterpreted as the right direction. It's a compass. It points in a direction. That's all that anyone could expect a compass to do.</p> <p>Maybe the second spindle was the \"obedience\" meter so you know that the first spindle isn't to be trusted.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Scripture/Book%20of%20Mormon/Seafaring/#duration","title":"Duration","text":"<p>Chapter 17's headings summarize the events as: first, being commanded to build a ship, and... the rest of the chapter is pretty much Nephi preaching a 19th century American protestant sermon, calling them to repentance, and then giving them the Jedi lightning zap.

How much time passed between L&amp;L being coerced into cooperating and the ship's completion? No way of knowing. Could have been a day or two.

We should see evidence of these industries being widespread enough to permit all of these records that are being thrown into a fire.

If they were paper mills, I imagine we'd see evidence of that, too. In either case, we'd see signs of literacy being prevalent in ancient America.

Threw me off real good)</p> <p>Then-Elder Nelson wrote about this in the Ensign in 1993.</p> <p> </p> <p>These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance of gold. Each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound together in a volume as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art of engraving. With the records was found a curious instrument, which the ancients called \u201cUrim and Thummim,\u201d which consisted of two transparent stones set in the rims of a bow fastened to a breastplate. Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I translated the record by the gift and power of God.</p> <p>\u2014 The Wentworth Letter, Ensign July 2002</p> <p>This doesn't fit quite as neatly\u2014 this is reportedly in Joseph's own voice, claiming he uses the Urim &amp; Thummim to translate the plates directly.</p> <p> </p> <p>In 2000, two BYU religion professors, Joseph Fielding McConkie (son of Elder Bruce R. McConkie) and Craig J. Ostler, wrote an essay titled, \u201cThe Process of Translating the Book of Mormon.\u201d (Check the URL: this is BYU-I\u2019s online library.) They wrote:</p> <p>Thus, everything we have in the Book of Mormon, according to Mr.\u00a0Whitmer, was translated by placing the chocolate-colored stone in a hat into which Joseph would bury his head so as to close out the light. While doing so he could see \u2018an oblong piece of parchment, on which the hieroglyphics would appear,\u2019 and below the ancient writing, the translation would be given in English. Joseph would then read this to Oliver Cowdery, who in turn would write it. If he did so correctly, the characters and the interpretation would disappear and be replaced by other characters with their interpretation.</p> <p>Alright, I guess if we go with divine intervention, we can accept this unprecedented method. This recounting could be what contributes to Joseph asserting that this is \"the most correct of any book on earth\".</p> <p>That does bring into question why there were later revisions or edits, though.</p> <p> </p> <p>After laying the groundwork, the professors continue:</p> <p>Finally, the testimony of David Whitmer simply does not accord with the divine pattern. If Joseph Smith translated everything that is now in the Book of Mormon without using the gold plates, we are left to wonder why the plates were necessary in the first place. It will be remembered that possession of the plates placed the Smith family in considerable danger, causing them a host of difficulties. If the plates were not part of the translation process, this would not have been the case. It also leaves us wondering why the Lord directed the writers of the Book of Mormon to take a duplicate record of the plates of Lehi. This provision which compensated for the loss of the 116 pages would have served no purpose either.</p> <p>Further, we would be left to wonder why it was necessary for Moroni to instruct Joseph each year for four years before he was entrusted with the plates. We would also wonder why it was so important for Moroni to show the plates to the three witnesses, including David Whitmer. And why did the Lord have the Prophet show the plates to the eight witnesses? Why all this flap and fuss if the Prophet didn\u2019t really have the plates and if they were not used in the process of translation?</p> <p>What David Whitmer is asking us to believe is that the Lord had Moroni seal up the plates and the means by which they were to be translated hundreds of years before they would come into Joseph Smith\u2019s possession and then decided to have the Prophet use a seer stone found while digging a well so that none of these things would be necessary after all. Is this, we would ask, really a credible explanation of the way the heavens operate?</p> <p>I don't know that there's much more to add, really. I don't like the idea that scholarly studies can reliably conclude so many things, excluding theological matters- I imagine that would be the dismissal for this account: \"spiritual matters require spiritual methods,\" or something to that effect.

But around 590 BCE, Nephi saw horses standing around ~2,800 years before they arrived. I've read the rationalization that Nephi didn't actually mean horse when he said horse\u2014it was actually a tapir. You know, the animal with a reputation and capacity for pulling chariots! (1, 2)</li> <li>Elephants: Described in Ether, went extinct well before Ether's timeline</li> <li>Cattle and cows: If the most correct book on earth, written for our day, is to be taken at face value, \"cows\" refer to \"cows.\" They were seen by Nephi and were also introduced by Europeans in 16th century. If cows actually means Bison, then they wouldn't fit Nephi's description of being \"for the use of man.\" If cows actually means mountain goats or llamas then what the fuck are we talking about</li> <li>Sheep: Appear numerous times in the text, including use of \"lamb-skin.\" No evidence of domesticated sheep before Columbus. Before we argue that the text refers to non-domesticated sheep, check the search results and tell me if the uses sound like wild animals. (sheep before shearers, numbereth his sheep, \"I know my sheep, and they are numbered\", sheep of the good shepherd, etc)</li> <li>Goats: Differentiating between goats and wild goats raises some questions. What makes the wild ones different? Are the non-wild ones domesticated? By whom? Does this mean Nephi saw domesticated goats standing around, waiting for humanity to drop by? Are we going to be satisfied with this differentiation, but \"horses\" might not actually mean horses, and cows weren't cows?</li> <li>Swine: Depending on where you draw the line between swine and other pig-like ungulates, swine might not have existed in pre-Columbian America. If you can rationalize that swine really meant peccaries, then I guess you win\u2014those are down in Brazil, which is on the correct continent.</li> <li>Barley and wheat: Both grains were introduced by European contact. Were not present before 1492.</li> <li>Silk: Depending on where you draw the line between silk and other fine cloth, this is dubious. What we, today, call silk is spun into fabric, and what ancient Aztecs did was cut and piece together nests from a species of moth. Which would you rather cover your body with?</li> <li>Chariots or wheeled vehicles: No evidence of wheels in pre-Columbian America.</li> <li>Iron and steel: I've got some notes on iron and steel elsewhere; suffice it to say, evidence that they existed in pre-Columbian America isn't looking good.</li> <li>Cimeters: \"Did you see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords! Curved swords!\" If pre-Columbian America didn't have iron or steel, they didn't have metal swords\u2014curved nor straight.</li> <li>System of exchange based on measures of grain using precious metals as a standard: No evidence that Pre-Columbian America used currency like what the BoM describes.</li> <li>Knowledge of Hebrew and Egyptian languages: I intend to get into text &amp; literacy in ancient America, but suffice it to say that when Moroni rationalizes writing in Reformed Egyptian over Hebrew, we should expect to find signs of ancient America being literate in both of those languages, possibly more. Evidence shows no literacy in any written language.

Iron ores are widely distributed, and the other raw material, charcoal, was readily available.

The brittleness can be decreased by reheating the steel within the range of 350\u00b0 to 500\u00b0 C (660\u00b0 to 930\u00b0 F), in a process known as tempering.

Text recorded on paper isn't useful if lay people are illiterate. In order for this story in Alma 14 to make sense (to me) we need enough lay people to be literate in order warrant enough economical demand for paper copies of scripture in the first place.

We should see evidence of these industries being widespread enough to permit all of these records that are being thrown into a fire. Even if it's multiple small forges to manufacture metal sheets, rather than one big industrial factory, that's something archaeologists would have spotted by now. If they were paper mills, I imagine we'd see evidence of that, too. In either case, we'd see signs of literacy being prevalent in ancient America.

Instead, the Church and Ensign Peak created thirteen limited liability corporations (\u201cLLCs\u201d), including twelve similar LLCs (the \u201cClone LLCs\u201d) with addresses located throughout the U.S., for the sole purpose of filing Forms 13F and preventing public disclosure by Ensign Peak of the Church\u2019s equity securities holdings.

The first presidency made these calls. Not \u201cthe church\u201d in vague, general terms. Not a random functionary we can throw under the bus, to pin the blame on. The First Presidency.

Ensign Peak has no shareholders or members. The securities portfolio managed by Ensign Peak consists of what the Church calls \u201creserve funds\u201d or \u201creserves,\u201d which include U.S. equity and debt securities purchased with excess tithing, income and returns generated by Ensign Peak, and the assets of other Church integrated auxiliaries.</p> <p>These are not operating moneys. They are reserves of \"excess\" tithing money. Why do they have excess tithing? Did we run out of poor people to care for? I will not be told that the church uses tithing money for charitable purposes, while simultaneously having any amount of \"excess\". I seem to recall an important fellow in the New Testament saying something along the lines of \"For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.\" (1, 2, 3) Is it unreasonable to think that this means we should always have an immediate, urgent use for tithing money, such that it shouldn't ever reach an investment portfolio?</p> <p>I\u2019d say it\u2019s safe to assume that this agency issuing this public document is a fair authority to say that that last sentence describing the securities portfolio is definitive. All Ensign Peak does is manage tithing money. It\u2019s tithing money. One could argue that some of it is interest on income\u2026 based on tithing. That doesn't make it better. It\u2019s still tithing money. It\u2019s profit made off of tithing that I had been assured is used for charitable purposes.</p> <p>Note on \u201cintegrated auxiliary\u201d: That means it\u2019s still part of the church, and has no obligation to submit 990\u2019s or 501c3\u2019s. Nothing independent about it.</p> <p>Paragraph 4 says, in so many words, that any organization with over $100 million in securities needs to submit 13f forms.</p> <p> </p> <p>Throughout its history, the securities portfolio Ensign Peak managed for the Church contained a wide range of equity and fixed income assets. At its inception, Ensign Peak managed approximately $7 billion of Church assets, a significant percentage of which consisted of Section 13(f) Securities. The portion of Section 13(f) Securities in the portfolio grew to approximately $37.8 billion by 2020.</p> <p>Ensign Peak's inception was in 1997, lest we overlook that detail. \u201cA significant percentage\u201d of the $7b in 1997 were securities that right from the start should have been reported under 13f forms. Right from the beginning, at its inception, the church\u2019s money in Ensign Peak was 70x over the minimum, and they never sent in those forms.</p> <p>Not all securities require 13f form submission. Church has some of those assets. I\u2019ve heard the claim (haven\u2019t found solid info to back it up) that around 1/3 of the assets do, and here we have a quantifiable number of $37.8 billion. That\u2019s $113.4 billion managed by Ensign Peak alone, assuming that figure is accurate.</p> <p>If that number is inaccurate, meaning more or less, I can still get behind the idea that not all assets require 13f submission.

What is the church doing with your tithing?</p> <p> </p> <p>Since 2000, Ensign Peak received and relied upon legal counsel regarding how to comply with its reporting obligations while attempting to maintain the privacy of the portfolio. As a result, Ensign Peak established separate companies (LLCs) that each filed Forms 13F instead of a single aggregated filing. Ensign Peak and the Church believe that all securities required to be reported were included in the filings by the separate companies.</p> <p>Ensign Peak relied on external legal counsel? You mean EPA doesn't have its own internal legal team? The church itself isn't comprised entirely of lawyers up at the top? And not one of you thought to read the requirements on how to file a tax form?</p> <p>If they relied on legal counsel from an external source, wouldn't they also be culpable in this violation? If that's the case, then either I misunderstand how punitive charges work, or the legal counsel was not external. From an outside perspective, I'm very interested to find out more about the legal counsel that EPA received and relied on.</p> <p> </p> <p>In June 2019, the SEC first expressed concern about Ensign Peak\u2019s reporting approach. Ensign Peak adjusted its approach and began filing a single aggregated report. Since that time, 13 quarterly reports have been filed in full accordance with SEC requirements.</p> <p>13 quarterly reports? Filing form 13f, concerning 13 shell companies? Get your tinfoil hats!</p> <p>Really, though, to have \"expressed concern\" sounds a bit light for a government agency capable of levying fines. \"Reporting approach\" is a very soft way of saying \"committing fraud via shell companies\".

The first time I hear solid information about where it's actually going, it's going to fraud.</p> <p>I surmise (and I cannot emphasize the word \"surmise\" enough here) that the church agreed to settle to avoid a high-profile court appearance. $5 million total for greater control of the story. They can say they \"consider the matter closed\", and then refuse to answer any further questions.

According to the order, the Church was concerned that disclosure of its portfolio, which by 2018 grew to approximately $32 billion, would lead to negative consequences. To obscure the amount of the Church\u2019s portfolio, and with the Church\u2019s knowledge and approval, Ensign Peak created thirteen shell LLCs, ostensibly with locations throughout the U.S., and filed Forms 13F in the names of these LLCs rather than in Ensign Peak\u2019s name.

The 14th page could be an Excel spreadsheet. I refuse to believe that Ensign Peak doesn't have the required fields tabulated in some variation or another. The form is to declare what positions your company holds. If an organization were to be given a cease-and-desist \"for Disclosure Failures and Misstated Filings\", it is because it was intentional.</p>"},{"location":"Tithing/SEC/WSJ%20Interview/","title":"\ud83d\udde3 WSJ Interview","text":"<p>I've got some comments on a Wall Street Journal article, which provides some insights to the LDS Church's tithing, spending on temples, charitable giving, among other things. It's got some excerpts from interviews with presiding bishopric members. Props to the journalist Jonathan Weil who put this together. </p> <p>The direct source for the 2023 article can be found here. If you're an absolute madman, you can pay money for something to read on the internet, or you could check some archived versions (1, 2)</p> <p>I'll include here some excerpts from the article that I found particularly noteworthy.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Tithing/SEC/WSJ%20Interview/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<p>A whistleblower revealed a few years ago that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had an estimated $100 billion investment portfolio, and at the time, church officials called the holdings a rainy-day account.</p> <p>At the time? Did they change the rationale for cosplaying Smaug after being caught?</p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cWe have a vision of the church that is\u2014can I use the word grandiose?\u201d said G\u00e9rald Causs\u00e9, the church\u2019s presiding bishop, in an interview. \u201cBecause we believe the gospel has to be taken to all the world. And so we see the size of the church multiple times what it is now, in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Causs\u00e9 and other church officials declined to discuss details of the church\u2019s finances, such as the costs of building temples or the size of the church\u2019s assets.</p> <p>Well... I suppose that would sound very optimistic if membership statistics didn't show a downward trend.</p> <p> </p> <p>Causs\u00e9 said keeping the church\u2019s financial information confidential is a matter of principle. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us that we maintain our privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a value that\u2019s important for religion.\u201d</p> <p>Causs\u00e9, you and I have a very different idea of what it means to maintain privacy. If I tried to pull the shit you're doing, I'd get thrown in prison.</p> <p> </p> <p>The $100 billion investment portfolio first came to light in 2019, after a former fund manager at the church\u2019s investment arm, Ensign Peak Advisors, filed a whistleblower complaint with the Internal Revenue Service.</p> <p>The former employee, David Nielsen, said Ensign Peak shouldn\u2019t be treated as a tax-exempt charity because it didn\u2019t use any of its money for religious, charitable or educational activities.</p> <p>In February, the church and Ensign Peak agreed to fines of $1 million and $4 million, respectively, to settle Securities and Exchange Commission claims that they obscured the church\u2019s investment holdings. The SEC alleged the church used more than a dozen hard-to-trace shell companies to file false disclosure reports that hid the size of its investments for almost 20 years.</p> <p>Causs\u00e9 declined to discuss details of the SEC settlement. \u201cWe recognize mistakes, and we regret mistakes,\u201d he said. The church says cash from Ensign Peak helps fund its religious, charitable and educational activities. \u201cThere is no other purpose. Nobody is getting rich,\u201d Causs\u00e9 said. \u201cEverything goes to these.\u201d</p> <p>Mistakes? You're calling this a mistake? It's a decision that the first presidency had to make each quarter, over twenty years! I'm not accusing the church leadership of \"getting rich,\" I'm saying there is no justifiable reason for a religious institution to have that much money sitting in an investment portfolio! End world hunger! Solve homelessness! Fund yourself a better PR department!</p> <p> </p> <p>As the SEC requires, Ensign Peak now discloses its U.S. stockholdings\u2014a subset of the total\u2014which it valued at $46.2 billion as of March 31. The figure doesn\u2019t include other types of investments, such as bonds, private equity or real estate.</p> <p>This can't be understated; 46 billion is a subset.</p> <p> </p> <p>The church also has misstated its assets on federal tax returns. On its 2007 return, Ensign Peak put down \u201c1,000,000\u201d for its total assets. The real number was about $38,000,000,000, an Ensign Peak document shows. In later years, Ensign Peak wrote \u201cover 1,000,000\u201d on its returns. The church followed the same practices on its own IRS returns, where it reports business income unrelated to its tax-exempt mission.</p> <p> ayyy don't worry so much, it was only off by 37,999,000,000.</p> <p>But don't worry, they recognize mistakes and regret mistakes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Church officials said they believe that, as a religious organization, the church doesn\u2019t have to disclose its assets. Todd Budge, another member of the presiding bishopric, said anyone familiar with the church would know its assets exceeded $1 million. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accurate answer. It wasn\u2019t meant to be an accurate answer,\u201d said Budge, a 63-year-old former banking and private-equity executive. \u201cIt was simply meant to communicate that we do not feel that we\u2019re obligated to fill in that box.\u201d</p> <p>THAT'S NOT HOW TAXATION LAWS WORK, TODD</p> <p>Are you saying that the IRS should be counted among those \"familiar with the church\" who \"would know its assets exceeded $1 million\"? You are a former banking and private-equity executive, for Christ's sake. You are not doing this out of ignorance. You are not being cheeky and coy about this. This is not a guessing game. You are literally breaking federal laws.</p> <p> </p> <p>The last bit I have notes in is pertaining to charitable donations, which I'll put in its proper page and section.</p> <p>As I understand the risk factors of investing, one shouldn't invest money that they can't afford to lose entirely. Stock market could crash and it'd all go away. Assuming this conventional wisdom scales into billions, the church could shrug off a $46 billion loss. How much money would they have to have stashed elsewhere to have that sense of confidence?</p>"}]}
